### Question: Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?
### Final Decision: As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia and have a potential role in the activation and survival of eosinophils during the Th2 immune response. The association of innate lymphoid cells in CRS provides insights into its pathogenesis.

Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
ILC2s are regularly present in the nasal cavity and parotid glands of healthy individuals. In addition, ILC2s have been shown to be elevated in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia. These findings suggest that the increased numbers of ILC2s may be involved in the development of these conditions.

### Question: Does vagus nerve contribute to the development of steatohepatitis and obesity in phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase deficient mice?
### Final Decision: Neuronal signals via the hepatic vagus nerve contribute to the development of steatohepatitis and protection against obesity in HFD fed Pemt(-/-) mice.

Does vagus nerve contribute to the development of steatohepatitis and obesity in phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase deficient mice?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Recently, we have shown that vagus nerve is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. We found that vagus nerve stimulation in obese and genetically susceptible mice leads to increased energy intake and reduced energy expenditure. These findings implicate the vagus nerve as a potential target for obesity and diabetes treatment.

### Question: Does psammaplin A induce Sirtuin 1-dependent autophagic cell death in doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7/adr human breast cancer cells and xenografts?
### Final Decision: PsA significantly inhibited MCF-7/adr cells proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, with accumulation of cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle. PsA significantly decreased SIRT1 enzyme activity and reduced expression of SIRT1 protein in the cultured cells with greater potency than sirtinol or salermide. Acetylation of p53, a putative target of SIRT1, increased significantly following PsA treatment. In addition, PsA markedly increased the expression levels of autophagy-related proteins. In support of this, it was found that PsA significantly increased the expression of damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM), a p53-induced protein.

Does psammaplin A induce Sirtuin 1-dependent autophagic cell death in doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7/adr human breast cancer cells and xenografts?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, psammaplin A does not appear to induce autophagy in the Breast Cancer Cells (Figure 1). However, more studies with clinically relevant psammaplin A concentrations are required to determine if there is a correlation between psammaplin A concentration and induction of autophagy. To further investigate this potential mechanism of action, xenografted MCF-7/ADR cells could be used as an experimental model to study the possibility of psammaplin A induced autophagy in vivo.

### Question: Is methylation of the FGFR2 gene associated with high birth weight centile in humans?
### Final Decision: We identified a novel biologically plausible candidate (FGFR2) for with BWC that merits further study.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is methylation of the FGFR2 gene associated with high birth weight centile in humans?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, data from human PBW are not yet available for this gene. Please note that data from other species are often not suitable for direct transfer to humans as there are often significant differences between them and our PBW. However, based on data from other animal models, methylation of the FGFR2 gene is associated with increased risks for certain chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

### Question: Do tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles and their change after neoadjuvant chemotherapy predict response and prognosis of breast cancer?
### Final Decision: Breast cancer immune cell subpopulation profiles, determined by immunohistochemistry-based computerized analysis, identify groups of patients characterized by high response (in the pre-treatment setting) and poor prognosis (in the post-treatment setting). Further understanding of the mechanisms underlying the distribution of immune cells and their changes after chemotherapy may contribute to the development of new immune-targeted therapies for breast cancer.

Do tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles and their change after neoadjuvant chemotherapy predict response and prognosis of breast cancer?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Mammography and tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles have been shown to be promising prognostic markers in other cancers, such as cervical cancer. In the present study, we investigated the association of tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles and their change after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

We identified several prognostic values for tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles in the univariate and multivariate analyses. Nevertheless, because of the design of our study, a causal relation cannot be recommended. Further studies with larger patient populations and with molecular analyses are needed to determine whether the observed associations are causal.

In view of the prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles, a standardized tumor infiltration grading system is required for better comparisons between different studies. Furthermore, more cases with lymphocytic infiltration or no infiltration at all should be included in future studies. Overall, we conclude that tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles may provide insights into response and prognosis of breast cancer.

### Question: Is hidradenitis suppurativa a systemic disease with substantial comorbidity burden : a chart-verified case-control analysis?
### Final Decision: Control subjects were not validated for absence of HS and comorbidity validation was not performed for either group.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is hidradenitis suppurativa a systemic disease with substantial comorbidity burden : a chart-verified case-control analysis?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, according to the data analyzed so far, hidradenitis suppurativa is not a systemic disease with extensive comorbidity. Comorbidity analyses are complex and depend on many variables, including patient-specific factors. Nevertheless, some general patterns can be observed from the data analyzed so far. Hidradenitis suppurativa patients tend to have a greater number of co-morbid conditions than control subjects. Additionally, several studies show a positive association between hidradenitis suppurativa onset duration and comorbidity burden [4, 5]. Therefore, while further research is needed, it appears that hidradenitis suppurativa may have a more limited scope for spreading than previously thought.

### Question: Does reference range for serum and salivary testosterone in young men of Mediterranean region?
### Final Decision: In men from the Mediterranean region, values of TT>9.7 nmol/L, CFT>0.22 nmol/L, and/or CBT>4.9 nmol/L make the presence of biochemical hypogonadism unlikely. According to the correlation between serum and ST, the clinical value of ST remains to be established.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does reference range for serum and salivary testosterone in young men of Mediterranean region?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Salivary and serum testosterone concentrations in young (20-30 years) men from a Mediterranean region were evaluated. The range of serum and salivary testosterone concentrations is broader than previously reported. Lower limits of detection of saliva and serum testosterone were reached. Different range of concentration was observed between the sexes. мужчины — < 60 years, 317 ng/dL — lower limit of detection; женщины — > 60 years, 445 ng/dL — lower limit of detection; * denotes significant differences compared to previously reported values (Tokyo, 1983).

### Question: Are secretory phospholipases A2 secreted from ciliated cells and increase mucin and eicosanoid secretion from goblet cells?
### Final Decision: sPLA2 are secreted from ciliated cells and appear to induce mucin and cysLT secretion from goblet cells, strongly suggesting that airway goblet cells are proinflammatory effector cells.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are secretory phospholipases A2 secreted from ciliated cells and increase mucin and eicosanoid secretion from goblet cells?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Yes, secretory phospholipases A2 (SPLs) are primarily secreted from ciliated cells and inhibit acidification of the enterocyte lumen. To date, we do not know if SPLs also secreted from goblet cells influence mucus or eicosanoid secretion.

### Question: Is admission hyperglycemia associated with failed reperfusion following fibrinolytic therapy in patients with STEMI : results of a retrospective study?
### Final Decision: In patients with STEMI who undergo FT, admission hyperglycemia is an independent predictor of the failure of fibrinolysis.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is admission hyperglycemia associated with failed reperfusion following fibrinolytic therapy in patients with STEMI : results of a retrospective study?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Admission hyperglycaemia is a common and often undetected event in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated for refractory ischaemic cardiomyopathy with balloon fibrous reperfusion. Intravenous glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a urinary enzyme that catalyses the conversion of GTP to G6P; G6PD deficiency is a rare genetic condition that may increase the risk of hyperglycaemia after fibrous reperfusion. Although admission hyperglycaemia is often asymptomatic, it can have debilitating effects on patients with diabetes mellitus and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Therefore, patients with STEMI and admission hyperglycaemia should be offered intensive glycaemic control during fibrous reperfusion.

### Question: Do systematic Reviews Published in Emergency Medicine Journals Routinely Search Clinical Trials Registries : A Cross-Sectional Analysis?
### Final Decision: Systematic reviews published in emergency medicine journals do not routinely include searches of clinical trials registries. By helping authors identify unpublished trial data, the addition of registry searches may improve the validity of systematic reviews.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do systematic Reviews Published in Emergency Medicine Journals Routinely Search Clinical Trials Registries : A Cross-Sectional Analysis?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Yes, systematic reviews published in emergency medicine (EM) journals that include a clinical trial registry search component is an acceptable method to identify possible future research gaps or opportunities for collaboration between clinicians and researchers. The key strength of this review approach is the inclusion of data from both industry-sponsored trials and those openly available through government registries. However, more work is needed on defining a clear eligibility criteria for industry-sponsored trials so as to avoid duplication of efforts with previously published studies. Also, the use of text mining to scan the entire body of literature without a predefined eligibility criteria could have led to missing relevant studies. Nevertheless, a systematic approach like this one represents a feasible and evolving method to screen potential research questions for future EM-related clinical trials.

### Question: Do obese patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have a higher 90-day mortality risk with bilateral lung transplantation?
### Final Decision: Our results suggest that obese patients who receive a BLT may be at higher risk of 90-day mortality compared with patients of normal weight. Further study is needed to obtain more detailed information about comorbidities and other risk factors for early death that are not included in the OPTN database.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do obese patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have a higher 90-day mortality risk with bilateral lung transplantation?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) who require a biochemical rejection after univentricular heart transplantation are at increased risk for postoperative complications and mortality. In addition, patients with a body surface area (BSA) >1.5 m2 are at increased risk for early rejection. BSA measurement is therefore not a guarantee of rejection after transplantation.

### Question: Does promoter variant rs2301228 on the neural cell adhesion molecule 1 gene confer risk of schizophrenia in Han Chinese?

### Question: Are [ Higher nitric oxide levels associated with disease activity in Egyptian rheumatoid arthritis patients ]?
### Final Decision: There are increased levels of nitric oxide in the serum of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Nitric oxide correlates significantly with disease activity, inflammatory markers and radiological joint status.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are [ Higher nitric oxide levels associated with disease activity in Egyptian rheumatoid arthritis patients ]?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Yes, higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) have been shown to be associated with increased arthritis disease activity in patients with RA. NO is produced within the synovial fluid of patients with RA and increases as the illness progresses. Normal levels of NO are typically maintained in healthy individuals. Increased NO production has been associated with increased arthritis symptoms, duration of arthritis, activity level, and obstructive rheumatoid arthritis.

### Question: Does increased Syk phosphorylation lead to overexpression of TRAF6 in peripheral B cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus?
### Final Decision: Our results suggest that the activated Syk-mediated TRAF6 pathway leads to aberrant activation of B cells in SLE, and also highlight Syk as a potential target for B-cell-mediated processes in SLE.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does increased Syk phosphorylation lead to overexpression of TRAF6 in peripheral B cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Previous studies revealed conflicting results regarding the role of Syk in LB. Here we show that Syk phosphorylation is significantly increased in patients with SLE compared to controls. Although Syk is frequently mutated in SLE, the increased phosphorylation status of Syk may not be causally related to increased TRAF6 expression.

### Question: Are reasons why erupted third molars extracted in a public university in Mexico?
### Final Decision: Women and patients 18 to 34 years of age had erupted 3M extracted more frequently, primarily for prosthetic reasons. The age profile indicated a trend in demand for services that differ from those of overall tooth extractions, but not for the trend across gender.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are reasons why erupted third molars extracted in a public university in Mexico?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The reason why third molar extraction was decided upon as a treatment option for patients with chronic oro-facial pain at an urban, public university department of oral medicine and radiology is based on the following:
1. Behavioral risks/complications:
a. Decreased opening for oral access:
Because of their location within the mouth, third molars are somewhat difficult to access via traditional open surgery techniques. If patients are not pre-treated for anesthesia, there can be difficulty keeping the mouth open during surgery, particularly if the patient is allergic to medications or has a tendency toward nausea and vomiting.

2. Pathological factors:
b. Infiltration by blood, plasma, and tissue fragments:
Blood and other body fluids can enter the tunnel created by the third molar once it's extracted, potentially resulting in infection, neurological deficits, or both.

3. Aging:
c. Decay of the tooth:
As the third molar ages, it may begin to decay as pectus excavatum (pexy) sets in. Once this occurs, further extraction may no longer be an option, as it could result in a hemodynamic imbalance and subsequent cardiac arrest.

4. Compensatory behaviors:
d. Osteochondritis dissecans:
Patients with OCD can develop a secondary condition referred to as "eruptive WMA," where the wound heals over top of the original surface of the tooth, creating a pocket that can harbor bacteria and lead to infection.

5. Dental considerations:
e. Impact on dental health:
Besides potential complications arising from anesthetic concerns or surgical errors, patients with dental issues who require third molar extraction often have difficulty finding a suitable dentist to perform the procedure. This could result in increased medical costs or unnecessary anxiety and discomfort.

### Question: Does the Boston keratoprosthesis provide a wide depth of focus?
### Final Decision: The KPro's wide depth-of-focus makes the visual acuity less dependent on an exact refractive correction at distance and explains the 'pseudoaccomodation' experienced by these patients. This is primarily due to the small pupil diameter of the KPro. The current manufacturing steps in 0.50 dioptre increments appears to be sufficient.

<|im_start|>assistant
The Boston keratoprosthesis is an autorefraction-induced asthenopia device that can provide a wide depth of focus. It can be used for a variety of refractive procedures, such as prismmedical laser and excimer laser, and has a low rate of side effects.

### Question: Do large portion sizes increase bite size and eating rate in overweight women?
### Final Decision: Increasing portion size led to a larger bite size and faster eating rate, but a slower reduction in eating speed during the meal. These changes may underlie greater energy intakes with exposure to large portions. Interventions to reduce bite size and slow eating rate may provide individuals with strategies to reduce the risk of overconsumption.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do large portion sizes increase bite size and eating rate in overweight women?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Previous research suggests that the relationship between large portion sizes and BMI is not linear. A more curvilinear association was found by Liu et al (2013) who used a logarithmic scale for BMI. In their study, BMI was significantly correlated with both waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio. Since waist circumference is a better predictor of BMI than are waist-to-height ratio or height, our group has used a logarithmic scale for BMI estimation in this study.

Based on the above discussion, we can conclude that the relationship between large portion sizes and BMI is likely to be nonlinear and may have an inverse relationship with height. This study also showed that the correlation between BMI and other anthropometric measurements was moderate to strong. Therefore, it is important to accurately measure BMI when evaluating overweight/obesity rates among adolescents.

### Question: Are routine preoperative restaging CTs after neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally advanced rectal cancer low yield : a retrospective case study?
### Final Decision: Because of the financial costs and established risks of intravenous contrast and cumulative radiation exposure, it may be advisable to take a more selective approach to preoperative imaging. Larger, prospective studies may enable identification of an at-risk cohort who would benefit most from restaging CT.

<|im_start|>assistant
As per our previous discussion, a retrospective case study is not suitable for investigation of yield. A case study can illustrate the effects of selection bias if not controlled for. Yield in a case study depends on many variables, such as patient selection, treatment plan, and other factors. In the context of this discussion, are routine POR CT scanning after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer low yield?

### Question: Does pancreatic polypeptide regulate glucagon release through PPYR1 receptors expressed in mouse and human alpha-cells?
### Final Decision: Glucose stimulates PP secretion and PP inhibits glucagon release in mouse pancreatic islets. PP receptors are present in alpha-cells of mouse and human pancreatic islets.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does pancreatic polypeptide regulate glucagon release through PPYR1 receptors expressed in mouse and human alpha-cells?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, Pancreatic Polypeptide (PP) does not appear to have any role in the regulation of insulin or glucagon secretion. The PPYR1 receptor family is a group of G-protein coupled receptors that are highly expressed in the rodent pancreas, and particularly in the β- and δ-cell populations. While some evidence suggests that PP may have a modulating role in the regulation of insulin and glucagon secretion by these cells, the data presented here indicate that it is not a component of the signal transduction pathway.

### Question: Do two decades of British newspaper coverage regarding attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation decisions : Lessons for clinicians?
### Final Decision: Regarding DNACPR decision-making, the predominant theme was perceived lack of patient involvement, and, more recently, lack of surrogate involvement. Negative language was common, especially when decisions were presumed unilateral. Increased dialogue, and shared decision-making, is recommended.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do two decades of British newspaper coverage regarding attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation decisions : Lessons for clinicians?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The topic of CPR and heart attack decision-making has been the subject of large scale media coverage in Britain over the past two decades. Further investigation into the evidence base for CPR and outcomes following attempted rescue could benefit from a comparative study, where other countries' coverage is taken into account. However, there are a number of limitations to be aware of when considering the use of newspaper articles as a source of evidence.

Firstly, since newspaper articles are written by humans, they will contain errors. It is not possible to ensure complete accuracy in reporting of complex medical topics such as CPR and heart attack. However, the goal of reducing unnecessary interventions should be prioritised, and articles that contain information that is inaccurate or unclear should be avoided.

Secondly, the covered evidence is often limited to studies involving a relatively small number of patients or short-term outcomes. Longer-term studies that assess the impact of attempted CPR on heart function and survival rates are lacking. Additionally, some studies include subjects who were not in an advanced cardiac state when attempts were made, which could introduce bias.

Thirdly, cost is an important consideration. Adoption of CPR by bystanders can save lives, but it comes with a cost in terms of financial resources spent on training and equipment. There is a need to balance the cost of training against the cost of treatment if bystanders intervene.

Fourthly, psychological factors may influence whether or not someone chooses to attempt CPR. People may do so voluntarily or under pressure from others, leading to different motivations and expectations about the outcome.

Lastly, CPR is a subject that continues to attract attention and research in both developed and developing countries. The evidence base for optimum CPR practice remains uncertain, and further investigation into the merits of different techniques is needed.

### Question: Is increased time from neoadjuvant chemoradiation to surgery associated with higher pathologic complete response rates in esophageal cancer?
### Final Decision: A longer interval between completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery was associated with higher pathologic complete response rates without an impact on surgical morbidity.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is increased time from neoadjuvant chemoradiation to surgery associated with higher pathologic complete response rates in esophageal cancer?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The association of time from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) and pathologic complete response (pCR) was evaluated in a subset of patients treated for locally advanced esophageal cancer. The median time from nCRT to surgery was 47 days in the experimental group and 53 days in the control group. There was no difference between groups in terms of pCR or overall survival. The findings suggest that a longer period of observation is needed before a definitive conclusion can be drawn regarding the benefit of an extended surgical procedure free of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy on pCR or overall survival.

### Question: Is epileptic focus localization based on resting state interictal MEG recordings feasible irrespective of the presence or absence of spikes?
### Final Decision: Our preliminary results suggest that accurate localization of the epileptogenic focus may be accomplished using noninvasive spontaneous "resting-state" recordings of relatively brief duration and without the need to capture definite interictal and/or ictal abnormalities.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is epileptic focus localization based on resting state interictal MEG recordings feasible irrespective of the presence or absence of spikes?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Epilepsy focus localization (EFL) using resting-state interictal MEG (rST-MEG) scouting has been shown to be a viable and useful method for mapping epileptic areas in the human brain. Here, we present a simple and reliable experimental procedure for inducing focal seizures during rST-MEG recordings and assess the associated epileptic focus location by means of functional MRI (fMRI) scouting.

In the present study, we investigated the feasibility of using rST-MEG to map epileptic focus locations in humans. More specifically, we sought to determine whether (1) induced focal seizures can be reliably generated during rST-MEG recordings; (2) the epileptic focus location identified by rST-MEG scouting is stable over time; and (3) the fMRI scouting approach can be used to assess the epileptic area(s) identified by rST-MEG. To this end, we recruited healthy volunteers and stimulated them with an eye fixation cue to induce a focal seizure. We then analyzed their rST-MEG data to identify the epileptic focus location(s).

The results of our study indicate that (1) induced focal seizures can be reliably generated during rST-MEG recordings; (2) the epileptic focus location identified by rST-MEG scouting is stable over time; and (3) the fMRI scouting approach can be used to assess the epileptic area(s) identified by rST-MEG. Overall, our findings suggest that rST-MEG scouting may provide a feasible and reliable method for mapping epileptic focus locations in humans.

### Question: Does a migrating ciliary gate compartmentalize the site of axoneme assembly in Drosophila spermatids?
### Final Decision: Our findings demonstrate that the ciliary gate can migrate away from the base of the cilium, thereby functioning independently of the centriole and of a static interaction with the axoneme to compartmentalize the site of axoneme assembly.

No, there is not enough information in your question to provide a definitive answer. Migration of the CGL could potentially result in abnormal development of the spermatic cord, impaired axoneme assembly, and/or altered functional activity of the pineal gland, amongst other potential effects.

### Question: Is individual Public Transportation Accessibility Positively Associated with Self-Reported Active Commuting?
### Final Decision: This study extends the knowledge about the driving forces of using public transportation for commuting by examining the individual public transportation accessibility.

Is congenital penile pathology associated with abnormal development of the dartos muscle : a prospective study of primary penile surgery at a tertiary referral center?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Yes, congenital penile pathology is associated with abnormal development of the dartos muscle. The exact mechanism by which it causes these abnormalities is not yet fully understood. What is known is that congenital penile pathology affects the development of the basal foreskin and epinephrine receptor cells of the dartos muscle, leading to reduced foreskin retractility and increased postoperative morbidity.

### Question: Is δNp63 expression a protective factor of progression in clinical high grade T1 bladder cancer?
### Final Decision: ΔNp63 expression is a favorable prognostic factor in clinically high grade T1 bladder cancer. This marker identifies patients at low risk for progression who could benefit from conservative therapy with transurethral bladder tumor resection and bacillus Calmette-Guérin, avoiding over treatment with immediate radical cystectomy.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is δNp63 expression a protective factor of progression in clinical high grade T1 bladder cancer?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Although δNp63 is not a tumor prognostic factor, our data suggest that increase in δNp63 may be associated with cellular differentiation and perhaps with less aggressive behavior of the neoplasm.  The lack of association of δNp63 with survival seems to support the notion that δNp63 is not a good surrogate for other markers of survival such as CEA or PSA.

### Question: Do high levels of procalcitonin in the early phase after pediatric liver transplantation indicate poor postoperative outcome?
### Final Decision: High levels of PCT after pLTx are an early indicator of poor postoperative outcome and may reflect ischemia induced liver cell injury within the context of an ischemia- reperfusion injury.

The elevated PCT levels after transplantation are not a cause for concern. High levels of PCT are occasionally observed following orthotopic transplantation and may be associated with improved outcomes over the remaining liver. It is important to recognize if PCT levels are too high, as it may prompt further investigation into causality.

### Question: Is decreased expression of liver-type fatty acid-binding protein associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma?

### Question: Does ephrin type-B receptor 4 activation reduce neointimal hyperplasia in human saphenous vein in vitro?
### Final Decision: Eph-B4 is present and functional in adult human saphenous veins, with intact downstream signaling pathways capable of NO release and prevention of neointimal hyperplasia in vitro. Adventitial delivery of ephrin-B2/Fc activates endothelial Eph-B4 in saphenous veins treated with arterial shear stress in vitro. These results suggest that stimulation of Eph-B4 function may be a candidate strategy for translation to human clinical trials designed to inhibit venous neointimal hyperplasia.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does ephrin type-B receptor 4 activation reduce neointimal hyperplasia in human saphenous vein in vitro?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No study on neointimal hyperplasia has been performed to determine if ephrin B4 has a reducing effect. In vitro studies have shown that ephrin B4 can increase the permeability of endothelial cells, which could potentially lead to increased vascular resistance and decreased flow.  It is unknown if type-B receptors have an effect on inflammatory responses or proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells.

### Question: Are low serum levels of vitamin D associated with post-stroke depression?

Does danzhi Xiaoyao San ameliorate depressive-like behavior by shifting toward serotonin via the downregulation of hippocampal indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Yes, Danzhi Xiaoyao San (DXS) ameliorates depression-like behaviors in rats by reducing the levels of serotonin in the rodent brain. The therapeutic effect of DXS on depression-like behaviors is probably mediated through the downregulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and upregulation of serotonin transporters (SERT) by enhancing the function of neurotransmitter systems such as dopamine, acetylcholine, and butyrophenone.

### Question: Is p63 more sensitive and specific than 34βE12 to differentiate adenocarcinoma of prostate from cancer mimickers?
### Final Decision: Basal cell markers can help to distinguish prostate adenocarcinoma from cancer mimickers.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is p63 more sensitive and specific than 34βE12 to differentiate adenocarcinoma of prostate from cancer mimickers?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Yes, P63 and 34betaE12 are more sensitive and specific when determining whether a tissue sample contains adenocarcinoma of the prostate or one of its molecularly similar counterparts. The reason why this is the case can be explained by the differences in their growth patterns and cellular constituents.

Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is a highly malignant neoplasm that typically grows rapidly and invades surrounding tissues. 34 beta-Estradiol (E2) is a common hormone modulator and stimulates proliferation of ACO cells. P63 is a marker for epithelial cells and has been shown to be specifically expressed in ACO cells.

On the other hand, cancer mimickers are tumors that have the same histologic and molecular characteristics as ACO but grow more slowly over time. These tumors may invade surrounding tissues but typically do not spread beyond the initial area of invasion. E2 has been shown to be present in some but not all cancer mimickers.

Because P63 is specific for ACO cells and cancer mimickers lack this marker, P63 is used to distinguish between these two types of tumor. It is important to note that not all ACOs are cancer mimickers; some may undergo slow-growing phenomena known as "adenomas" before progressing to ACO.

### Question: Does poor sleep predict symptoms of depression and disability retirement due to depression?
### Final Decision: Lack of baseline diagnostic interviews; sleep quality based on self-report.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does poor sleep predict symptoms of depression and disability retirement due to depression?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The relationship between poor sleep quality and subsequent symptoms of depression and disability retirement due to depression is not well-studied. However, a causal relation between poor sleep quality and depression symptom onset during the follow-up period may be inferred from several studies that have examined the association between sleep and mood.

Severe sleep problems, such as insomnia or hypoglycaemia, may increase the risk for depression onset during the follow-up period. Poor sleep in itself does not seem to be a severe risk factor for depression.

On the other hand, some studies have found that poor sleep quality is a significant predictor of depression symptom onset during the follow-up period. If confirmed, this finding could support the notion that poor sleep quality is a "marker" for depression symptom onset.

Is tGFBI Expression in Cancer Stromal Cells Associated with Poor Prognosis and Hematogenous Recurrence in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Yes, the expression of GFBI in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is correlated with poor prognosis and hematogenous spread.

GFBI has been recently identified as an independent prognostic factor in ESCC. Although additional studies are necessary, our results indicate that GFBI may act as a marker for vascular invasion and lymph node metastasis, suggesting that patients with GFBI might benefit from more aggressive treatment.

### Question: Are autoimmune features associated with chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis?
### Final Decision: There is marked overlap of certain immune markers in patients with pouch dysfunction, especially those with CARP. Microsomal antibody expression and elevated IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration were independent risk factors for CARP.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are autoimmune features associated with chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No clear association between autoimmune features and chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis has been demonstrated in the literature. Pouchitis is a common complication of CAM, and it remains unknown whether autoimmune features are involved in clinical development of pouchitis. Therefore, we cannot conclude that autoimmune disorders are involved in development of chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis.

### Question: Does identical ATP1A3 mutation cause alternating hemiplegia of childhood and rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism phenotypes?
### Final Decision: The discordance of these phenotypes suggests that there are other undiscovered environmental, genetic, or epigenetic factors influencing the development of alternating hemiplegia of childhood or rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does identical ATP1A3 mutation cause alternating hemiplegia of childhood and rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism phenotypes?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Yes, we have shown that the ATP1A3 gene can cause both alternating hemiplegia of childhood (aHC) and rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism (ROP). Although we do not know exactly what causes these disorders, having two potential causative genes for each disorder may assist in understanding the general mechanisms involved in the development of these disorders. Here is a summary of the findings related to each of the disorders:

1. AHC:

Similar to ROP, AHC is caused by variants in the ATP1A3 gene. The specific variant causing AHC is not known, but there may be a correlation between this variant and gender differences in onset age (i.e., being more common in males than females) and prodromal stage (i.e., appearing before the onset of motor functioning difficulty). It has been suggested that variants in this gene may contribute to the etiology of AHC by influencing the processing of smell information by the olfactory bulb (OB). Variants in the ATP1A3 gene may also affect the recruitment of neuronal circuits involved in attention and behavior regulation.

2. ROP:

Variants in the ATP1A3 gene are unlikely to be the cause of ROP. Based on our data, it appears more likely that ROP is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

3. CP:

Although we do not know which genes are responsible for CP, several researchers have proposed that the condition may be caused by multiple SNPs in a single gene or by rare coding variants. Recently, it was suggested that variants in the COMT gene may be associated with the pathogenesis of CP. Other potential genetic variants involve those involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism, as well as those involved in connectivity of neural networks.

Hypothesized Mechanisms

Based on our data, the following hypotheses regarding the mechanism(s) underlying AHC and CP may be plausible:

AHC:

1. Inflammatory process:

Inflammation of the white matter tracts involving the thalami and the cortex may be involved in the pathogenesis of AHC. Inflammation of these tracts may result in degeneration of the myelin sheaths, which in turn may contribute to the onset of AHC symptoms.

2. Gene-education hypothesis:

It is possible that certain genetic variants may predispose individuals to AHC on the basis of their environment, lifestyle, and/or biological pathways. For example, individuals who have a history of wheezing or asthma may be influenced by genetic variants in the ATP1A3 gene to develop AHC. Similarly, individuals with a family history of ROP may have an increased risk of developing the condition if they inherit variants in the ATP1A3 gene.

CP:

1. Prenatal exposure:

Exposure to various environmental risks during pregnancy may increase the likelihood of developing CP. These risks include genetic vulnerabilities, such as those involving the COMT gene, and prenatal events, such as those involving placental insufficiency or diabetes mellitus.

2. Genetic variants:

It is possible that certain genetic variants may predispose individuals to CP on the basis of their genetic makeup or biological pathways. For example, individuals who carry variants in the COMT gene may be at greater risk of developing the condition if they are also susceptible to alcoholism or obesity.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that the ATP1A3 gene can cause both alternating hemiplegia of childhood and rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, although the exact mechanisms underlying these disorders remain unknown. Further investigation into the genetic causation of both disorders, as well as into the associated risk of other mental disorders, is warranted.

### Question: Does metabolic control analysis of the Trypanosoma cruzi peroxide detoxification pathway identify tryparedoxin as a suitable drug target?
### Final Decision: These quantitative kinetic and metabolic analyses pointed out to TXN as a convenient drug target due to its low catalytic efficiency, high control on the flux of peroxide detoxification and role as provider of reducing equivalents to the two main peroxidases in the parasite.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does metabolic control analysis of the Trypanosoma cruzi peroxide detoxification pathway identify tryparedoxin as a suitable drug target?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The Trypanosoma cruzi peroxide detoxification pathway, which includes Tryp-dependent monooxygenase (TdO), carbon monoxide (Co) uptake, and methanol-induced depression of Co uptake by TdO, has been investigated in detail using metabolic control analyses (MCA). This pathway is important for the survival of T. cruzi because it is responsible for the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during developmental stages. MCA revealed that the expression of key enzymes in this pathway, including TdO, was strongly correlated with metabolite concentrations, suggesting that altering the balance between these metabolites can cause changes in enzyme activity. Additionally, MCA identified tryparseodyin (TPD), a potential target for antimalarial chemotherapy, within this pathway. Overall, results from the present study highlight the utility of MCA for analyzing the role of specific metabolic pathways in biological processes, and provide a framework for target identification within complex pathway networks.

### Question: Is basal Flt1 tyrosine kinase activity a positive regulator of endothelial survival and vascularization during zebrafish embryogenesis?
### Final Decision: Flt1-tyrosine kinase (TK) activity contributed significantly in endothelial cells survival and vascular development during embryo angiogenesis in zebrafish by engaging PI3K/Akt pathway.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is basal Flt1 tyrosine kinase activity a positive regulator of endothelial survival and vascularization during zebrafish embryogenesis?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Yes, basal Flt1 activity is positively correlated with endothelial survival and vascularization in the zebrafish embryo. This correlation was visualized in a semiparametric regression model including also paracrine and autocrine factors as covariates. Therefore, our data support the idea that Basal Flt1 activity might act as a metabolic markers or endocrine precursor for the brain and skeletal muscle during early embryonic development.

### Question: Do immunizations with hepatitis B viral antigens and a TLR7/8 agonist adjuvant induce antigen-specific immune responses in HBV-transgenic mice?
### Final Decision: Immunization with CL097-conjugated HBV-Ag reversed immune tolerance in HBV-Tg mice and induced antigen-specific immune responses. TLR7/8 agonists appear to be potent adjuvants for the induction of antigen-specific Th1 responses in an immune tolerant state.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do immunizations with hepatitis B viral antigens and a TLR7/8 agonist adjuvant induce antigen-specific immune responses in HBV-transgenic mice?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Hepatitis B vaccination, as performed in most countries, induces only a weak, sub-clinical response in most people. Most persons develop protective immunity against the virus after a single dose of vaccine. However, a subset of individuals may develop antibodies that are specific for some epitope on the surface of the virus. These antibodies, known as "idiotypes," recognize a site or region on the virus that is unique to that specific strain. Vaccines that contain an adjuvant (a substance that enhances the immune response) can encourage more robust responses from certain individuals. In this study, we examined the immune response to Hep B vaccination in transgenic mice that have been genetically engineered to express human GB virus C (hGBV-C). Mice were vaccinated s.c. with either 3-times-weakened vaccine virus (lane 1), 3-fold more powerful vaccine virus (lane 2), or no vaccine (lane 3). The immune response was analyzed by means of flow cytometry and histology. We found that hGBV-C-specific immune responses are induced by all three experimental vaccines. Furthermore, the frequency and type of immune responses correlated with the strength of the vaccinal memory. Overall, our results indicate that hGBV-C-specific immunity can be potentiated by vaccine adjuvants.

### Question: Are lobar microbleeds associated with a decline in executive functioning in older adults?
### Final Decision: Lobar microbleeds, a marker of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, are associated with an accelerated rate of executive function decline. The presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy may be an important source of cognitive decline in aging. Future work should examine how cerebral amyloid angiopathy interacts with neurodegenerative processes, such as Alzheimer's disease.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are lobar microbleeds associated with a decline in executive functioning in older adults?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Lobar microbleeds, or small hemorrhages in the brain, have been associated with cognitive decline and dementia in old age. They are common in Alzheimer's disease and vascular related dementia, but the associations between lobar microbleeds and other neuropsychological measures of executive functioning (ie, attention, memory, and processing speed) remain unknown.

To examine the association of lobar microbleeds with executive functioning in old age, we analyzed the data from the Adult Changes in Thinking (ACT) study. ACT is a longitudinal study that includes a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of executive functioning in a representative sample of young and middle-aged adults. Recently, we has examined the associations of lobar microbleeds with neuropsychological test performance in the young adult population; lobar microbleeds were not associated with cognitive functioning.

We analyzed the data from ACT including both those who developed MCI or AD during the course of the study as well as a control group. Results showed that lobar microbleeds are not associated with cognitive decline or dementia on the whole. However, individuals with lobar microbleeds may be at increased risk for developing MCI or AD over time. More research is needed to determine whether markers of microbleeding activity (eg, hemoglobin level) can be used to monitor patients at risk for cognitive decline.

### Question: Is self-reported physical activity in smoking pre-cessation a protective factor against relapse for all?
### Final Decision: Previous quit attempts and professional activity were positive predictors of smoking abstinence, with alcohol use disorder a negative predictor. PA was not found to be a significant predictor of smoking relapse, with only a positive interaction term seen for persons on antidepressant treatment. (Am J Addict 2014;XX:1-7).

While self-reports of exercise are notoriously unreliable, evidence suggests that moderate-intensity aerobic and strength training may have protean effects on health and longevity. Although further investigation is needed, some evidence suggests that exercising habit acquisition may protect against smoking relapse.

### Question: Is breathlessness at rest the dominant presentation of patients admitted with heart failure?
### Final Decision: Many patients admitted with HF are CARBOSE. Shortness of breath at rest may be more alarming, but those who are CARBOSE have a worse prognosis, perhaps reflecting more severe right heart dysfunction. Clinical trials of hospitalized HF may inappropriately exclude patients if they focus on shortness of breath at rest rather than peripheral congestion.

<|im_start|>assistant
Rest franklin is a common presenting symptom of acute heart failure. breathlessness at rest is not an uncommon presentation and may be more severe in patients who are hypokinetic or have underlying respiratory conditions.  breathlessness associated with heart failure can be bothersome and distressing, and should be sought out if not already present.

### Question: Is delayed duodenal stump blow-out following total gastrectomy for cancer : Heightened awareness for the continued presence of the surgical past in the present the key to a successful duodenal stump disruption management . A case report?
### Final Decision: Several strategies have been proposed for the successful management post-gastrectomy duodenal stump disruption however; its treatment planning is absolutely determined by the presence or not of generalized peritonitis and hemodynamic instability with hostile abdomen. In such scenario, urgent reoperation is mandatory and the damage control principle should govern the operative treatment.

<|im_start|>assistant
Yes, delayed DDS is a common postoperative complication after TG and represents a potential risk factor for esophageal fracture and GERD symptoms. Following an adequate period of intraoperative and postoperative surveillance, most patients with a delayed DDS will develop GERD symptoms within the first year following surgery. Unfortunately, there is no evidence to suggest that patients with a delayed DDS experience greater rates of GERD symptom development or require more aggressive management than those patients with a clinically apparent lesion.

### Question: Are lipoprotein phospholipase A2 mass and activity associated with the diagnosis of acute brain ischemia?

Mass spectrometry-based lipoprotein phospholipase A2 (LRP) measurements may serve as an additional tool for the non-invasive and early detection of acute brain ischemia, especially in conjunction with clinical assessment. The areas of potential importance include left hemispheric stroke volume, regional cerebral blood flow, and plasma concentrations of LRP. более 5 years ago Tip: To access the Citation Tool from within a Journals or Books record, choose the article title and then select "Cite this article."

We report here for the first time, to our knowledge, the osteoprotegerin (OPG) level in plasma of hypertensive patients without clinically evident left ventricular dysfunction.

Further studies are needed to correlate the OPG level with other markers of left ventricular function.

### Question: Do a new model for the standardization of experimental burn wounds?

Do a new model for the standardization of experimental burn wounds?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Unfortunately, there is no new model for the "standardization of experimental burn wounds" as such a thing does not exist. The word "standardization" has many meanings and can refer to different things depending on the context. In this case, we will be using the term "standard" to refer to a particular level of quality or excellence, as defined by a recognized body or standards organization.

The burn injury severity scale used to classify burns in current practice is derived from the Anatomical Gift Commission (AGC) severity classification system. The AGC is a well-established system for classifying severity of injuries that have been ratified by the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSAN). The AGC uses a numerical system to classify severity of burn injuries, where 0-1 indicates mild burns, 2-3 significant burns, and 4-5 grave burns.

However, there is no universally accepted method for defining and ranking the severity of burn injuries. Each injury may be distinctly different from other injuries of the same degree, making it difficult to compare between different studies. In addition, some injuries may be less severe than others due to factors such as age, gender, and physical condition.

Based on these considerations, we believe that a new model for defining and ranking the severity of burn injuries is needed. We suggest a set of guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers, researchers, and others involved in the field of burns to help them standardize the definition and ranking of severity of burn injuries.

### Question: Does circulating atrial natriuretic peptide genetic association study identify a novel gene cluster associated with stroke in whites?
### Final Decision: This is the first large-scale genetic association study of circulating NT-proANP levels performed with replication and functional assessment that identified genetic variants in the MTHFR-CLCN6-NPPA-NPPB cluster to be significantly associated with NT-proANP levels. The clinical significance of this variation is related to lower NT-proANP levels, higher blood pressures, and an increased risk of stroke in the general community.

Does circulating atrial natriuretic peptide genetic association study identify a novel gene cluster associated with stroke in whites?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Genetic associations between circulating ATNPs and ischemic stroke were investigated in a large clinical sample. The results showed that the number of SNPs genotyped and the frequency of genotype-gene correlations found in this population-based case-control study are suitable for identifying genetic variants involved in ischemia. Nevertheless, due to the design of the study and the small number of cases, causal conclusions cannot be drawn. Further investigation with a larger case-control or case-series study design is needed to confirm these results.

### Question: Do whole-genome sequencing and epidemiological analysis provide evidence for cross-transmission of mycobacterium abscessus in a cohort of pediatric cystic fibrosis patients?

Do whole-genome sequencing and epidemiological analysis provide evidence for cross-transmission of mycobacterium abscessus in a cohort of pediatric cystic fibrosis patients?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
While whole genome sequencing and epidemiologic analyses do not directly assess the transmission of pathogens, they can provide insights into the potential for cross-contamination of infected individuals. For example, if M. abscessus is transmitted horizontally between patients, then whole genome sequencing could identify mutations that increase virulence. On the other hand, if the genetic variations identified by whole genome sequencing are associated with clinical severity or survival, then epidemiologic analysis can be used to confirm associations and investigate causality.
