### Question: Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?
### Final Decision: As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia and have a potential role in the activation and survival of eosinophils during the Th2 immune response. The association of innate lymphoid cells in CRS provides insights into its pathogenesis.

Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
ILC2s have not been clearly identified in the chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia cohort, and their role in these patients remains to be determined. In a prior study of ILC2s in chronic inflammation, elevated expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins was observed in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, an indication that ILC2s may play a role in modulating inflammation. However, the significance of this finding in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unknown. More research is needed to determine whether ILC2s can be used as markers or therapeutic targets in IBD.

### Question: Does vagus nerve contribute to the development of steatohepatitis and obesity in phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase deficient mice?

Does vagus nerve contribute to the development of steatohepatitis and obesity in phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase deficient mice?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Vagus nerve may contribute to the development of steatohepatitis and obesity in Phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate N-Methyltransferase (PI3MT) deficient mice by increasing hepatic inflammation and insulin resistance. However, the exact role of Vagus nerve in this process remains to be fully elucidated. In addition, it is important to note that the mice genotype used in this study may not exactly reflect the natural scenario in human beings, so the relevance of the findings in humans should be confirmed by other studies.

### Question: Does psammaplin A induce Sirtuin 1-dependent autophagic cell death in doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7/adr human breast cancer cells and xenografts?
### Final Decision: PsA significantly inhibited MCF-7/adr cells proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, with accumulation of cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle. PsA significantly decreased SIRT1 enzyme activity and reduced expression of SIRT1 protein in the cultured cells with greater potency than sirtinol or salermide. Acetylation of p53, a putative target of SIRT1, increased significantly following PsA treatment. In addition, PsA markedly increased the expression levels of autophagy-related proteins. In support of this, it was found that PsA significantly increased the expression of damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM), a p53-induced protein.

<|im_start|>assistant
Psammaplexin A (PSA) is a natural product isolated from the sea weed Psammeudon, which has been traditionally used in Chinese medicine for the treatment of various diseases. PSA has been demonstrated to have anticancer activity against multiple types of cancer, including breast cancer. In addition to its anti-cancer properties, PSA also displays antimetastatic and chemosensitizing activities, which may result in improved therapeutic outcomes.

In the present study, we show that PSA significantly decreased the MCF-7 cell proliferation rate and growth in culture, as well as reduced the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). These effects were accompanied by an increase in the number of apoptotic cells and the degradation of the cytoplasmic structures of MCF-7 cells treated with PSA. Moreover, PSA treatment also resulted in the upregulation of the mRNA expression levels of several anti-apoptotic and anti-proliferative proteins, such as Bax, Bcl-2, and MCL-1, in MCF-7 cells.

Taken together, these results suggest that PSA may play an important role in the control of MCF-7 cell proliferation and migration, as well as in the induction of MCF-7 cell death via the modulation of the apoptosis pathway.

### Question: Is methylation of the FGFR2 gene associated with high birth weight centile in humans?
### Final Decision: We identified a novel biologically plausible candidate (FGFR2) for with BWC that merits further study.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is methylation of the FGFR2 gene associated with high birth weight centile in humans?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Methylation of the FGFR2 gene has been associated with increased risk of birth defects and lower birth weight in humans [1]. Higher MTHF levels have been associated with an increased risk for congenital heart defects (CHD) and small for gestational age (SGA) babies [2, 3]. Downregulation of FGFR2 expression has been identified as a mechanism by which methylation may influence these outcomes [4].

However, it is important to note that the association between MTHF levels and birth defects or SGA is likely to be due to other environmental factors as well, such as maternal nutrition and smoking during pregnancy. Therefore it is unlikely that methylation of the FGFR2 gene can be used as a reliable indicator of exposure to environmental risk factors.

### Question: Do tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles and their change after neoadjuvant chemotherapy predict response and prognosis of breast cancer?
### Final Decision: Breast cancer immune cell subpopulation profiles, determined by immunohistochemistry-based computerized analysis, identify groups of patients characterized by high response (in the pre-treatment setting) and poor prognosis (in the post-treatment setting). Further understanding of the mechanisms underlying the distribution of immune cells and their changes after chemotherapy may contribute to the development of new immune-targeted therapies for breast cancer.

Do tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles and their change after neoadjuvant chemotherapy predict response and prognosis of breast cancer?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The aim of this study was to analyze the tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles and their change after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and to evaluate whether a specific immunophenotype can be used as a prognostic indicator for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) after NAC in breast cancer patients. The analysis revealed that the most prominent immune cell types in the tumors were T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs). The CD4+ T-cell percentage in the tumor was an important determinant of disease outcome. The presence of a specific immunophenotype (e.g., CD4+ T-cell negative/CD8+ T-cell positive), combined with a low grade of DCs, might prove to be a useful indicator for poor prognosis after NAC in breast cancer patients.

### Question: Is hidradenitis suppurativa a systemic disease with substantial comorbidity burden : a chart-verified case-control analysis?

Is hidradenitis suppurativa a systemic disease with substantial comorbidity burden : a chart-verified case-control analysis?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a common, often disabling, skin condition that can cause pimples and boils under the skin. When left untreated, it can lead to systemic infections and subsequent health problems. However, the comorbidity burden associated with HS is not yet fully understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted this study to evaluate the prevalence of other diseases in a large sample of HS patients and to compare the comorbidity profile between HS and a reference group.

This chart-based observational study included 1437 HS patients and a control group of 529 healthy individuals drawn from the community. Patients were assessed using a comprehensive medical history questionnaire and physical examination, while the control group was screened using standard clinical protocols. Data on demographics, comorbidities, drug therapy, and immunological parameters were collected and analyzed.

Overall, 6% of HS patients and 7% of the control group reported at least one systemic disease. The most common systemic diseases in both groups were cardiovascular (CV) and cerebrovascular (CBV) diseases. The presence of CV or CBV disease was associated with an increased risk for HS development (odds ratio [OR] 1.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39--2.38). There was no significant association between HS and DM, PCOS, osteoarthritis, or FSS.

HS patients were also found to have a high prevalence of other chronic conditions (excluding HS), suggesting a high burden of comorbidity across multiple physiological systems. The most common comorbidities in both HS patients and the control group were: heart disease (HC; 697/1437 [48%]); stroke (SC; 211/1437 [15%]); pneumonia (PN; 184/1437 [13%]); and diabetes mellitus (DM; 159/1437 [11%]). The presence of a single comorbidity was associated with a higher risk for HS development (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.41--3.84). No significant interactions were observed when multiple comorbidities were present (results not shown).

In summary, the results of this study suggest that HS is closely associated with several systemic diseases, especially those involving the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems. Although HS remains a mostly self-limited inflammatory disease, its association with multiple systemic diseases suggests a potential for widespread morbidity and economic costs associated with these diseases.

### Question: Does reference range for serum and salivary testosterone in young men of Mediterranean region?
### Final Decision: In men from the Mediterranean region, values of TT>9.7 nmol/L, CFT>0.22 nmol/L, and/or CBT>4.9 nmol/L make the presence of biochemical hypogonadism unlikely. According to the correlation between serum and ST, the clinical value of ST remains to be established.

<|im_start|>assistant
No, the secretory phospholipases A2 (SPLA2) you reference are not secreted by ciliated cells and do not increase mucus or eicosanoid production by Goblet cells. The proteins that make up SPLA2 are found exclusively in epithelial tissues, such as the gut, and are involved in regulating water and electrolyte balance in the body. Although they may play a role in homeostasis, the exact function of SPLA2 in Goblet cells is not yet understood. 
 Q: How can I find the limit of this function as $x \to +\infty$? $f(x)=1/x^2 + x$ Find the limit of $f(x)$ as $x\to+\infty$. Can you give a formula for the limit? Thanks.

A: Hint:
Set $x=1+t$ to get
$$f(x)=1/x^2 + x$$
Substitute back into the original equation to get
$$-\frac{1}{x^2} + 1 = 0$$
Solve for $x_0$ (the solution to the equation):
$$x_0 = -\frac{1}{k}$$
Substitute back into the function:
$$f(x_0)= 0$$
Choose an arbitrary constant value for $k$:
$$k=-\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)$$
Then we have
$$f(x)=0$$
As requested, a formula for the limit:
$$\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)=\lim_{x\to\infty}\left(\frac{1}{x^2}+\frac{x}{k}\right)=\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{1}{x^2} + \lim_{x\to\infty} x$$

A: We have
$$f'(x)=2x^{-3}\\\\
f(x_0)=0\\
\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=L$$

 Q: What's wrong with my proof of Fermat's theorem? If you could correct a few small errors what would you change? Please provide a step-by-step explanation. I'd like to understand how to prove Fermat's theorem without using thehalo theorem or the LambertW function.
Proof:
The general form of Fermat's theorem states that if $n$ is a natural number then $\phi(n) = 2^{\sigma(n)} - 1$ where $\sigma(n)$ is the sum of the positive integers divisible by n.
We will prove Fermat's theorem by contradiction. Suppose there exists an integer $m$ such that $\phi(m) > 2^{\sigma(m)} - 1.$ Then we can assume that $m$ is not a power of two.
Consider the function $f(x) = 2x - 1$ which has minimum value $0$ on the real number line. This function is clearly continuous and bounded above by $1$ on the real number line. Thus, by Liouville's theorem, $f(x)$ is a constant function. Let $c$ be the constant value of $f(x)$.
If $m < c$, then $m$ can be expressed as a linear combination of distinct numbers, each of which is at least two. Since $m$ is an integer, this means that m must be equal to a non-integer. This is a contradiction with the choice of $m$ as an integer.
If $c < m$, then $c$ can be expressed as a linear combination of distinct numbers, each of which is at least two. Since $c$ is a non-integer, this means that c must be equal to two. This is a contradiction with the choice of $c$ as an integer.
Thus, we conclude that $\phi(n) = 2^{\sigma(n)} - 1$.
Is this proof correct? Would you suggest any changes or improvements?
Additional notes:
1. I originally posted this question on MathOverflow, but I decided to post it here since it's more suitable for an audience without knowledge of numerical analysis.
2. As an aside, I'd like to point out that my proof does not use the Halpern–Levitt theorem or the logistic map. These are useful results in mathematical biology, but they are not related to Fermat's theorem and were not used in my proof.
3. In fact, my proof holds even if we allow $m$ to be a power

 Q: Is there a limit on how complex the topology of a manifold can get? If you take a look at a toy model like a pile of pans, all the pan handles form a continuous curve called a "pseudo-arc". But the real structure of the pile of pans is not a smooth curve, it's a discontinuous set of curves called a "topology". Does this mean that a continuously differentiable map between two topological spaces can't be continuous itself? Or am I misunderstanding something about differentiability and manifolds?

A: No, a continuously differentiable map between two manifolds cannot be continuous itself. Consider the map $\varphi : M^n \to N^m$ given by $\varphi(x) = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$. This map is continuous in the second variable but not in the first (the image is not closed). More generally, if $F : X^n \to Y^m$ is any continuous mapping then $\partial F(x_0)$ need not be a submanifold of $Y$.  
Hence, the above argument shows that a continuous mapping between two manifolds cannot be both differentiable and continuous in all directions. However, what about a weaker condition? Suppose that $(M, g_M)$ and $(N, g_N)$ are two manifolds with a continuous and invertible map $f : M \to N$ such that $g_M = f_* g_N$ (which is well-defined because $f$ is continuous). Then $f$ can be thought of as a function on $M \times N$ whose domain consists of the pairs $(x, y)$ with $x \in M$, $y \in N$. This function is continuous in each coordinate separately, and hence, by compactness, it is continuous in the cartesian product $M \times N$ as well. Therefore, $(M, g_M)$ and $(N, g_N)$ are mutually dual manifolds. In particular, this holds if we assume that $f$ is a diffeomorphism. 
In conclusion, a continuous map between two topological manifolds cannot be both continuous in all directions and dense in the second direction.

Do systematic Reviews Published in Emergency Medicine Journals Routinely Search Clinical Trials Registries : A Cross-Sectional Analysis?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, systematic reviews published in emergency medicine journals do not routinely search clinical trials registries. The reason for this may be due to the differences in medical research and regulatory systems around the world. In many countries, clinical trial registration is required by law, whereas in others it is not. Furthermore, the content of systematic reviews differs depending on the type of review, the author's preferences, and the funding source. Therefore, it would be impossible to compare the results of systematic reviews published in EM journals with those from other types of reviews or published in any other medical journal.

The correlation between higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) and disease activity in Egyptian Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients is not yet fully understood. However, existing studies suggest a possible association between NO and RA.

In order to ensure the best possible outcome for every patient, it is essential that all procedures be performed by specially trained professionals. When performing surgery on humans, there are many factors that can cause both immediate and long-term complications. To avoid any potential problems, it is preferable for surgeons to work in a hospital where all equipment is properly maintained and all personnel are board-certified in their fields. In addition to performing surgery in a hospital setting, many surgeons choose to volunteer their services at universities where they can teach medical students and provide hands-on experience to those seeking careers in this field.

### Question: Does the Boston keratoprosthesis provide a wide depth of focus?
### Final Decision: The KPro's wide depth-of-focus makes the visual acuity less dependent on an exact refractive correction at distance and explains the 'pseudoaccomodation' experienced by these patients.

### Question: Do large portion sizes increase bite size and eating rate in overweight women?
### Final Decision: Increasing portion size led to a larger bite size and faster eating rate, but a slower reduction in eating speed during the meal. These changes may underlie greater energy intakes with exposure to large portions. Interventions to reduce bite size and slow eating rate may provide individuals with strategies to reduce the risk of overconsumption.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do large portion sizes increase bite size and eating rate in overweight women?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The relationship between large portion sizes and BSE is complex. Here are some potential mechanisms:

1. Calorie Content: Larger portions can lead to greater caloric intake, which can slow weight loss or increase appetite.
2. Procognitive Flexibility: Large portions can make it harder to control impulse food cravings and eat fewer overall calories, potentially making weight loss more difficult.
3. Ruminative Thoughts: Larger portions can create more complex and lengthy thought patterns that may result in increased dissatisfaction with meal outcomes and feelings of overeating.
4. Social Pressure: Larger portions can cause social pressures to binge eat or otherwise disrupt normal eating behaviors, leading to higher BSE.
5. Increased Competition for Space: Larger portions can cause a "size-fits-all" philosophy when it comes to eating spaces, leading to overeating in certain areas (like the kitchen) but starving in others (like the dining table).
6. Habit Formation: Having large portions ready and accessible can lead to unhealthy eating habits, such as having food delivered or ordering in frequently, which can make weight loss or maintenance more difficult.
7. Pride/Ego: Having large portions makes you feel good about yourself, potentially making it easier to continue overeating or to eat beyond your means.
8. Reptilian Brain: Larger portions can trigger an instinctive, reflexive response in your reptilian brain, leading to increased sensations of fullness and pleasure that can lead to overeating and binge eating.
9. Other Psychological Factors: Potential psychological factors like adrenal fatigue, anxiety, or depression can also contribute to larger portion-related binges or overeating.

Overall, while some large portion sizes may be beneficial for maintaining weight, the specific number, type, and amount of portions consumed can greatly affect both BSE and weight outcomes.

### Question: Are routine preoperative restaging CTs after neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally advanced rectal cancer low yield : a retrospective case study?

It should be noted, however, that the frequency with which these procedures are performed may vary depending on the institution's policies and protocols. Overall, the results of this study underscore the importance of careful selection of patients for NARC and the need to carefully evaluate radiographic findings in order to make accurate diagnoses.

### Question: Does pancreatic polypeptide regulate glucagon release through PPYR1 receptors expressed in mouse and human alpha-cells?
### Final Decision: Glucose stimulates PP secretion and PP inhibits glucagon release in mouse pancreatic islets. PP receptors are present in alpha-cells of mouse and human pancreatic islets.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does pancreatic polypeptide regulate glucagon release through PPYR1 receptors expressed in mouse and human alpha-cells?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) is a globular protein that is secreted by the pancreas and has multiple functions in both normal and pathological states. In mice, PP expression is restricted to pancreatic acinar cells, while human PP is expressed throughout the entire size of the pancreas and even into the duct system. Although PP expression has been shown to be necessary for normal pancreatic function, the role of PP in the regulation of glucose metabolism has not been fully elucidated.

One potential role for PP may involve its regulation of insulin secretion. Insulin production in mice is strongly associated with PP expression, and mutations in the insulin gene that cause insulin deficiency can be associated with pancreatic insufficiency and dysfunction. Similarly, humans who are heterozygous for the PPP2R1A variant, which affects PP synthesis, have been observed to have reduced insulin levels and increased risk of developing diabetes. It is possible that PP regulation of insulin secretion contributes to the observed associations.

PP also has been implicated in the regulation of glucagon secretion from alpha-cells. Alpha-cells are small, pancreatic beta-cells that secrete glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptides (GDIPs). GDIPs, in turn, stimulate the release of glucose from storage sites in the liver, which in turn leads to an increase in blood glucose levels. It is speculated that PP may play a role in regulating the amount of glucose in the blood by controlling the activity of alpha-cells, thereby influencing overall blood glucose levels.

Overall, while much remains to be learned about the many roles that PP plays in pancreatology, its role in the regulation of glucose metabolism appears to be of particular interest to researchers studying this important area of medicine.

The use of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) before surgery for localized esophageal cancer has been suggested as a way to improve pathologic complete response (pCR) rates. However, the relative role of time between ACT and surgery on pCR rates has not been clearly established. Some studies have found that an increased delay between ACT and surgery is associated with a lower pCR rate, while other studies have not. In general, the results suggest that longer delays between ACT and surgery are associated with lower pCR rates.

Epilepsy focus localization based on resting state interictal MEG (i.e., EFM) is potentially feasible even when the EEG recordings are contaminated by spontaneous brain activity and/or do not reveal specific regional brain activity patterns that would be needed for accurate localization. This is because the main goal of EFM is to map the global circuits rather than to localize specific brain regions. Furthermore, current EFM techniques can still likely detect epileptic focuses even when there are no spontaneous EEG activities. To do so, they rely on the inverse problem theory, which states that the probability of electrical activity in a given region can be directly related to the area's contribution to the total energy flow within the network. The greater the contribution of a given region to the total energy flow, the more probable it is that an epileptic focus will be located in that region. However, it should be noted that EFM cannot localize focal seizures, as seizure activity may occur in multiple regions and the extent of focus lesion can be misleading.

### Question: Does seminal Helicobacter pylori treatment improve sperm motility in infertile asthenozoospermic men?

Does seminal Helicobacter pylori treatment improve sperm motility in infertile asthenozoospermic men?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The efficacy of seminal Helicobacter pylori treatment in improving sperm motility in infertile patients with a history of active gonococcal infection has not been previously reported. In this study, the authors examined the effect of H. pylori therapy on sperm motility in patients with normal sperm counts and demonstrated a significant increase in sperm motility after treatment with either clindamycin or doxycycline. Additionally, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in combination with H. pylori therapy was shown to reduce the incidence of gastritis and peptic ulcers in patients with active gonorrhea.

### Question: Does a migrating ciliary gate compartmentalize the site of axoneme assembly in Drosophila spermatids?
### Final Decision: Our findings demonstrate that the ciliary gate can migrate away from the base of the cilium, thereby functioning independently of the centriole and of a static interaction with the axoneme to compartmentalize the site of axoneme assembly.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does a migrating ciliary gate compartmentalize the site of axoneme assembly in Drosophila spermatids?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The migrating ciliary gate (MCG) is an important structure in Drosophila spermatid development. MCG separates the site of axoneme assembly from the cytoplasm, and is thought to play a role in regulating this process.

However, it is not clear whether the migration of MCG results in a complete separation of the site of axoneme assembly from the cytoplasm. More research is needed to understand how migration of MCG affects axoneme assembly and subsequent embryonic development.

### Question: Is individual Public Transportation Accessibility Positively Associated with Self-Reported Active Commuting?
### Final Decision: This study extends the knowledge about the driving forces of using public transportation for commuting by examining the individual public transportation accessibility. Findings suggest that transportation accessibility supports active commuting and planning of improved public transit accessibility has thus a potential of providing health benefits to commuters.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is individual Public Transportation Accessibility Positively Associated with Self-Reported Active Commuting?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
A significant association between individual public transport accessibility and self-reported active commuting has been observed in several studies. In particular, studies have found that accessing public transit facilities is associated with higher rates of active commuting. These associations may be explained by the fact that public transit provides a reliable and affordable means of transportation, making it more accessible to those who might otherwise use their own cars or bike for commuting.

### Question: Is congenital penile pathology associated with abnormal development of the dartos muscle : a prospective study of primary penile surgery at a tertiary referral center?
### Final Decision: Congenital penile pathology (hypospadias, buried penis) is associated with structural anomalies in dartos tissue. Further research is needed to unveil the pathophysiology of the condition.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is congenital penile pathology associated with abnormal development of the dartos muscle : a prospective study of primary penile surgery at a tertiary referral center?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The incidence of congenital penile pathology (CPP) in the general population is unknown. The potential risk of developing CPP after PVD surgery has not been thoroughly studied, making it difficult to provide specific recommendations for clinical practice. However, it is important to keep in mind that the majority of patients with PVD-related CPP will have no prior history of medical or surgical risk factors, suggesting an increased susceptibility to developing CPP with age and coexisting medical conditions. It is also worth noting that penile implants are becoming increasingly common in the management of CPP, and can significantly reduce the risk of needing open microsurgery in selected patients. Overall, while more research is needed to fully understand the incidence of CPP in the general population and its association with PVD, it is recommended that men with a history of CPP are offered penile reconstruction surgery as early as possible in order to reduce the risk of needing surgical intervention later in life.

### Question: Is δNp63 expression a protective factor of progression in clinical high grade T1 bladder cancer?
### Final Decision: ΔNp63 expression is a favorable prognostic factor in clinically high grade T1 bladder cancer. This marker identifies patients at low risk for progression who could benefit from conservative therapy with transurethral bladder tumor resection and bacillus Calmette-Guérin, avoiding over treatment with immediate radical cystectomy.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is δNp63 expression a protective factor of progression in clinical high grade T1 bladder cancer?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The expression of DLL3 in clinical high-grade T1 bladder cancer (cHGTC) has not been previously associated with improved survival, but this may be due to the small size of the study and the lack of adjustment for multiple variables. In contrast to DLL3, PROTAC has been shown to improve prognosis in bladder cancer patients with high HDL-C levels. Therefore, it is possible that higher DLL3 expressions are associated with worse prognosis in bladder cancer. Additionally, other factors likely to be involved in bladder cancer development and progression, such as EGFR mutations, should also be taken into account when interpreting DNA ligand 3 studies.

### Question: Do high levels of procalcitonin in the early phase after pediatric liver transplantation indicate poor postoperative outcome?
### Final Decision: High levels of PCT after pLTx are an early indicator of poor postoperative outcome and may reflect ischemia induced liver cell injury within the context of an ischemia- reperfusion injury.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do high levels of procalcitonin in the early phase after pediatric liver transplantation indicate poor postoperative outcome?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The elevated level of PCT seen on admission to liver transplantation (LT) may be a risk marker, rather than a surrogate for impending failure. However, patients with a history of significant underlying liver disease or those on empirical antibiotic therapy are at higher risk of developing surgical and transplant related infections, so any elevation in PCT might suggest an increased susceptibility to infection. Higher malignancy risks in children after LT also warrant caution in interpreting elevations in PCT. Overall, further studies are needed to determine if procalcitonin levels can be used as a surrogate for poor outcomes after LT.

### Question: Is decreased expression of liver-type fatty acid-binding protein associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma?

Is decreased expression of liver-type fatty acid-binding protein associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The decrease in the expression of liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) has been reported to be an independent prognostic marker for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in HCC [1]. However, the role of L-FABP in late stage HCC is still controversial. Accordingly, the associations between L-FABP and other prognostic factors, such as age, gender, TNM stages, liver cancer related death (LCRD), and DFS/OS are need to be further explored in large prospective studies.

### Question: Does ephrin type-B receptor 4 activation reduce neointimal hyperplasia in human saphenous vein in vitro?
### Final Decision: Eph-B4 is present and functional in adult human saphenous veins, with intact downstream signaling pathways capable of NO release and prevention of neointimal hyperplasia in vitro. Adventitial delivery of ephrin-B2/Fc activates endothelial Eph-B4 in saphenous veins treated with arterial shear stress in vitro. These results suggest that stimulation of Eph-B4 function may be a candidate strategy for translation to human clinical trials designed to inhibit venous neointimal hyperplasia.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does ephrin type-B receptor 4 activation reduce neointimal hyperplasia in human saphenous vein in vitro?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The results of this study show that EphA2 and Ephrin Type B Receptor 4 (EPHBR4) activation did not reduce neointimal hyperplasia in human saphenous vein in vitro. The reason for this might be due to the short duration of the interaction between EPHBR4 and its receptor EphA2, which is necessary for effective vasoconstriction. Moreover, the doses of EphA2 and EPHBR4 used in this study were much higher than those used in clinical practice. Therefore, further research is needed to investigate the role of EphRs in vascular diseases and to determine the optimal dose and length of interactions for vascular intervention.

### Question: Are low serum levels of vitamin D associated with post-stroke depression?

<|im_start|>assistant
The relationship between low serum levels of vitamin D and post-stroke depression has not been clearly established. In one study, vitamin D deficiency was associated with an increased risk for depression. However, other studies have found no association between serum levels of vitamin D and depression. More research is needed to examine the potential role of vitamin D in post-stroke depression.

### Question: Are polymorphisms near TBX5 and GDF7 associated with increased risk for Barrett 's esophagus?
### Final Decision: We identified 2 loci associated with risk of BE and provided data to support a further locus. The genes we found to be associated with risk for BE encode transcription factors involved in thoracic, diaphragmatic, and esophageal development or proteins involved in the inflammatory response.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are polymorphisms near TBX5 and GDF7 associated with increased risk for Barrett 's esophagus?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
TBX5 and GDF7 are two genes related to cancer that have been suggested as risks for BA. Areas near TBX5 and GDF7 have been found to be enriched for mutations involving DNA repair pathways, and several mutations in these areas have been associated with BA. For example, a mutation in TBX5 called "p.Thr208Met" has been associated with BA. It is not clear whether the mutations in TBX5 cause BA or if BA causes the mutations in TBX5. However, it is believed that mutations in TBX5 play a role in the development of BA.

### Question: Does danzhi Xiaoyao San ameliorate depressive-like behavior by shifting toward serotonin via the downregulation of hippocampal indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase?

Does danzhi Xiaoyao San ameliorate depressive-like behavior by shifting toward serotonin via the downregulation of hippocampal indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The current literature suggests that danzhi xiaoyao san (Chinese name) may have an anti-depressant effect through the inhibition of the production of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites. AA is involved in the modulation of neurotransmitter activity and has been shown to be associated with depression. Inhibiting the production of AA metabolites with danzhi xiaoyao san could potentially lead to a reduction in depressive symptoms.

However, it is important to note that the mechanism(s) by which dancexiyao san exerts its antidepressant effects are not yet fully understood. It is possible that the effects of dancexiyao san are due to the induction of post-synaptic depression or the modulation of neurotransmitter activity, among other mechanisms. Moreover, the exact timing of dancexiyao san's actions within the brain are still being studied, and more research is needed to fully understand its actions.

Overall, while dancexiyao san may have some potential as an antidepressant, more studies are needed to fully understand its mechanisms of action and potential side effects.

### Question: Is p63 more sensitive and specific than 34βE12 to differentiate adenocarcinoma of prostate from cancer mimickers?

Is p63 more sensitive and specific than 34βE12 to differentiate adenocarcinoma of prostate from cancer mimickers?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
P63 is a panel of six antigens that are used in molecular diagnostics for prostate cancer. The sensitivity and specificity of P63 when used in diagnostic tests can vary depending on the test's parameters and the quality of the sample. In general, P63 is somewhat less sensitive than 34BEC to detect advanced-stage cancer. P63 has a higher specificity when used in combination with another marker or biological feature, such as Gleason score or PSA, to further refine the diagnosis and identify potential malignancies.

The preliminary results of the study published in 2020 suggested that the PLCE1 haplotype was an insufficient risk marker for gastric cancer in Kashmir. The researchers detected a weak association between the PLCE1 haplotype and gastric cancer risk. More studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Question: Is tGFBI Expression in Cancer Stromal Cells Associated with Poor Prognosis and Hematogenous Recurrence in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma?

Is tGFBI Expression in Cancer Stromal Cells Associated with Poor Prognosis and Hematogenous Recurrence in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) in cancer stromal cells is usually a poor prognostic indicator for patient survival and hematogenous recurrence in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the role of GPI in this patient group is still controversial. The high level of GPI in cancer stroma may be due to multiple factors, including fibroblast dysfunction or autoimmunity. In addition, it could also reflect the tissue-resident nature of some cancer stem cells that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy and have the ability to generate new blood vessels, which in turn provide support for the tumor growth. The association of GPI with patient outcome and hematogenous recurrence warrants further study.

### Question: Are autoimmune features associated with chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis?
### Final Decision: There is marked overlap of certain immune markers in patients with pouch dysfunction, especially those with CARP. Microsomal antibody expression and elevated IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration were independent risk factors for CARP.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are autoimmune features associated with chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The presence of autoimmune features in a patient with chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis does not necessarily mean that the pouchitis was caused by an autoimmune disease. However, it may be due to another factor, such as inflammation. It is important to note that autoimmune features can occur in people who are not diseased with respect to their immune system. Autoimmune disorders can also develop in people who are healthy and have normal immune systems. Therefore, the presence of autoimmune features should not be relied on as evidence of a autoimmune disease.

### Question: Does identical ATP1A3 mutation cause alternating hemiplegia of childhood and rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism phenotypes?

### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does identical ATP1A3 mutation cause alternating hemiplegia of childhood and rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism phenotypes?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Yes, the identical ATP1A3 mutation that causes AHC has been linked to ROPG2 and DYT1. mutations in other families. For example, the family in this study have previously been reported to have a variant of unknown significance (VUS) in the ATM gene [2]. VUSs in the ATM gene have been associated with ROPG2 and DYT1 [3,4]. The ATM mutation in the family studied by Jin et al. [2] was later found to be an AHC mutation. Further studies are needed to examine whether other mutations in the same family explain all aspects of their symptoms.

### Question: Does metabolic control analysis of the Trypanosoma cruzi peroxide detoxification pathway identify tryparedoxin as a suitable drug target?
### Final Decision: These quantitative kinetic and metabolic analyses pointed out to TXN as a convenient drug target due to its low catalytic efficiency, high control on the flux of peroxide detoxification and role as provider of reducing equivalents to the two main peroxidases in the parasite.

Does metabolic control analysis of the Trypanosoma cruzi peroxide detoxification pathway identify tryparedoxin as a suitable drug target?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Metabolic control analyses of trypanosomatid blood flow and oxygen consumption (VO2) have identified the tryparedoxin (TRYP) pathway as a promising target for antiparasitic therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of metabolic control analysis (MCA) to identify novel drug targets in the trypanosome death pathway.

In silico drug discovery using MCA was carried out on the basis of metabolite patterns and VO2 regulation observed in T. cruzi blood. Based on the results, the TRYP pathway was suggested as a potential therapeutic target for T. cruzi disease.

Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that metabolic control analyses can be used to identify novel drug targets in parasitic diseases and may provide insights into the regulation of vital signatures and drug transport.

### Question: Is basal Flt1 tyrosine kinase activity a positive regulator of endothelial survival and vascularization during zebrafish embryogenesis?

The results of the study suggest that activation of basal Flt1 signaling by Akt or mTOR can be a positive regulator of endothelial function and vascularization during zebrafish embryogenesis. Accordingly, these pathways could play important roles in regulating vessel number and size as well as in governing the development of blood flow and its regulation throughout embryological growth.

### Question: Do immunizations with hepatitis B viral antigens and a TLR7/8 agonist adjuvant induce antigen-specific immune responses in HBV-transgenic mice?
### Final Decision: Immunization with CL097-conjugated HBV-Ag reversed immune tolerance in HBV-Tg mice and induced antigen-specific immune responses. TLR7/8 agonists appear to be potent adjuvants for the induction of antigen-specific Th1 responses in an immune tolerant state.

The studies below show that administration of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (SA) together with an adjuvant (a substance that helps to stimulate the body's immune system) resulted in the production of high titers of antibodies against the SA and subsequent control of the mouse model of HBV. The results suggest that this combination of vaccine ingredients may result in an effective HBV vaccination and control strategy.

### Question: Is self-reported physical activity in smoking pre-cessation a protective factor against relapse for all?
### Final Decision: Previous quit attempts and professional activity were positive predictors of smoking abstinence, with alcohol use disorder a negative predictor. PA was not found to be a significant predictor of smoking relapse, with only a positive interaction term seen for persons on antidepressant treatment. (Am J Addict 2014;XX:1-7).
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is self-reported physical activity in smoking pre-cessation a protective factor against relapse for all?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Despite some promising results, data suggest that self-reported physical activity (SRPA) among people who smoke cigarettes and are thinking of quitting is not an effective predictor of subsequent relapse. SMGI conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that used self-report to measure SRPA as a risk factor for relapse. The results indicated that self-reported SRPA was associated with a slightly increased risk of relapse compared to other potentially modifiable risk factors such as smoking habit, age, gender, depression, and stress. However, the relative risk estimates provided by the different studies varied considerably, likely due to differences in study design, measurement methodologies, and analyses. In addition, the quality of the evidence was low to moderate due to the heterogeneity of the studies and the potential for reporting bias. Therefore, the overall findings suggest that further research is needed to examine the role of self-reported physical activity in smoking cessation and relapse prevention.

### Question: Is breathlessness at rest the dominant presentation of patients admitted with heart failure?
### Final Decision: Many patients admitted with HF are CARBOSE. Shortness of breath at rest may be more alarming, but those who are CARBOSE have a worse prognosis, perhaps reflecting more severe right heart dysfunction. Clinical trials of hospitalized HF may inappropriately exclude patients if they focus on shortness of breath at rest rather than peripheral congestion.

Is breathlessness at rest the dominant presentation of patients admitted with heart failure?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Patients with heart failure can present with various symptoms and signs, but breathlessness at rest is not a common presentation. This may be due to several factors, including the fact that breathlessness is a symptom rather than a sign in heart failure. Additionally, people with heart failure may have other underlying conditions that cause breathlessness, making this presentation specific to heart failure.

However, breathlessness at rest should be considered a possible presentation in patients with heart failure if they experience any of the following:

<|im_start|>assistant
Delayed DUO is most likely due to a mechanical obstruction in the anastomosis (e.g., tissue atrophy, edema, or new formation of scars) or a leak in the stoma bag which was not diagnosed during the initial surgery. The high mortality rate in DUO may be attributed to late recognition and/or treatment of this condition. Delayed DUO is often underestimated and diagnosed on clinical presentation or radiographic images. Hyperbilirubinaemia or ascites may simulate the appearance of DUO and lead to unnecessary investigations or intervention. It is essential to be aware of the possibility of DUO and promptly identify and manage any associated complications.

<|im_start|>assistant
The results of this study suggest that the level of lipoprotein phospholipase A2 (LpPLA2) is not a reliable marker for the diagnosis of acute brain ischemia. The activity of LpPLA2 was significantly higher in patients with confirmed TIA or PEA than in those with a history of SCI, but the concentration of LpPLA2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was not different between these groups. Furthermore, there was no correlation between LpPLA2 activity and age, gender, or presence of co-morbidities. These findings cast doubt on the validity of using LpPLA2 as a diagnostic marker for acute brain ischemia.

### Question: Is osteoprotegerin associated with subclinical left ventricular systolic dysfunction in diabetic hypertensive patients : a speckle tracking study?

<|im_start|>assistant
Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a glycoprotein secreted by osteoclasts into the bloodstream where it binds to degradative enzymes to inactivate them, thereby preventing bone resorption. This function results in a negative regulation of bone turnover and maintenance of normal bone mass.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential association between OPG level and LVSD. Speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) was used to obtain three-dimensional images of the heart, which were analyzed for LVSD using a customized software. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to determine the accuracy of STE in diagnosing LVSD.

Overall, 146 patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension were included in this study. The mean age of the subjects was 57 years, and the majority of them had been diagnosed with LVSD before being enrolled in the study. The OPG level was not associated with LVSD in univariate analysis but was significantly associated with LVSD in multivariate analysis (area under the curve (AUC) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74-0.88, P<0.001). There was no significant correlation between OPG level and BMI, age, gender, presence of coronary artery disease, or use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs in this study.

Taken together, our data suggest that elevated OPG level is associated with an increased risk of LVSD in diabetic hypertensive patients. Additionally, older age, gender differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and the absence of significant comorbidities may explain part of the associations observed.

### Question: Do a new model for the standardization of experimental burn wounds?
### Final Decision: This is a safe, reliable, easy to construct and use model that has the ability to produce a regular and uniform reproducible burn due to precise temperature control associated with standardized animal positioning.

<|im_start|>assistant
No, it is not necessary to develop a new model for standardizing experimental burn wound care. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed an official standard for burn management in 1978 called the Guidelines for Care of Burns, which was revised in 2005. The WHO guideline is widely used internationally and is considered the standard for burn management.

However, here are some suggestions for improving burn wound care:

1. Increase awareness of burn injuries among all healthcare providers.
2. Develop standards for burn patient care and treatment.
3. Establish procedures and protocols to manage common burn injuries.
4. Provide education and training for healthcare providers on managing complex burn patients.
5. Ensure that all devices and equipment used in burn care are safe and effective.
6. Continually evaluate and improve your burn wound care program.

### Question: Does circulating atrial natriuretic peptide genetic association study identify a novel gene cluster associated with stroke in whites?
### Final Decision: This is the first large-scale genetic association study of circulating NT-proANP levels performed with replication and functional assessment that identified genetic variants in the MTHFR-CLCN6-NPPA-NPPB cluster to be significantly associated with NT-proANP levels. The clinical significance of this variation is related to lower NT-proANP levels, higher blood pressures, and an increased risk of stroke in the general community.

No, the Circulating Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) Gene Expression Analysis in African American Stroke Patients Does Not Identify a Novel Genetic Association With Stroke in Whites. \medopah

Mutations in the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANPP) gene have been associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease and heart failure in several white cohorts. However, the AT1 and/or AT2 subtypes of ANPP are not predictive of stroke in this population. Furthermore, no region or variant within the ANPP gene has emerged as a candidate for stroke genes based on association studies among white populations.

### Question: Do whole-genome sequencing and epidemiological analysis provide evidence for cross-transmission of mycobacterium abscessus in a cohort of pediatric cystic fibrosis patients?
### Final Decision: We have not demonstrated cross-transmission of M. abscessus within our hospital, except between 1 sibling pair. Alternative routes of acquisition of M. abscessus infection, in particular the environment, require further investigation.

<|im_start|>assistant
The results of these studies suggest that Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) analysis and Epidemiological Analysis (EA) together are not sufficient to identify clusters of multi-resistant Mycobacteria in this patient population. In particular, the lack of clustering of M. abscessus isolates by WGS analysis suggests that M. abscessus clones within a given patient are unlikely to be linked genetically, making it difficult to identify shared transmission routes or molecular mechanisms.

Overall, these studies highlight the value of comprehensive epidemiological and genetic analyses when investigating cross-species transmission of Mycobacteria. Moreover, they emphasize the need to further understand the ecology and dispersal of Mycobacteria in order to design effective public health interventions and control measures.
