### Question: Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?
### Final Decision: As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia and have a potential role in the activation and survival of eosinophils during the Th2 immune response. The association of innate lymphoid cells in CRS provides insights into its pathogenesis.

Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Data on ILC2s in CHRS with nasal polyps and eosinophilia are scarce. In a retrospective study of patients with CHRS and nasal polyps who had also been treated with corticosteroids, ILC2s were identified in 35% of the cases.1 These ILC2s consisted of 9% lymphocytes and 86% macrophages or mononuclear cells. The overall frequency of ILC2s in this cohort was lower than that observed in the non-CHRS controls (67% versus 93%, P =.02). Additionally, ILC2s were significantly associated with increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), suggesting an association between these parameters and ILC2s.1 Although more studies are needed, these data suggest that ILC2s may be involved in the pathogenesis of CHRS and nasal polyps, and may serve as indicator cells for systemic inflammatory response.

### Question: Does vagus nerve contribute to the development of steatohepatitis and obesity in phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase deficient mice?

The results of these experiments indicate that the vagus nerve may play a role in the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis and obesity in PDHE1 knockout mice. In addition, these findings highlight the importance of long-term treatment with liver-safe chloroquine in preventing liver disease progression.

### Question: Does psammaplin A induce Sirtuin 1-dependent autophagic cell death in doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7/adr human breast cancer cells and xenografts?
### Final Decision: PsA significantly inhibited MCF-7/adr cells proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, with accumulation of cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle. PsA significantly decreased SIRT1 enzyme activity and reduced expression of SIRT1 protein in the cultured cells with greater potency than sirtinol or salermide. Acetylation of p53, a putative target of SIRT1, increased significantly following PsA treatment. In addition, PsA markedly increased the expression levels of autophagy-related proteins. In support of this, it was found that PsA significantly increased the expression of damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM), a p53-induced protein.

<|im_start|>assistant
Psammatol A, a derivative of Psammaplin A, has been shown to induce autophagic cell death (ACD) and necrosis in doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7/ADR human breast cancer cells and xenografts. When co-administered with doxorubicin, Psammatol A exhibited synergistic effects on ACD and necrosis, as well as improved clinical symptoms and prognosis for the mice bearing xenografts. Overall, these results indicate that Psammatol A might have an important role in the management of locally advanced gynaecological cancers and breast cancer, especially when combined with doxorubicin.

### Question: Is methylation of the FGFR2 gene associated with high birth weight centile in humans?
### Final Decision: We identified a novel biologically plausible candidate (FGFR2) for with BWC that merits further study.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is methylation of the FGFR2 gene associated with high birth weight centile in humans?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, methylation of the FGFR2 gene is not associated with high birth weight centile in humans. The reason for this may be due to the fact that birth weight is largely influenced by many different genetic and environmental factors. Additionally, the FGFR2 gene is highly conserved across species, which makes it unlikely that methylation levels affect human FGFR2 function.

### Question: Do tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles and their change after neoadjuvant chemotherapy predict response and prognosis of breast cancer?
### Final Decision: Breast cancer immune cell subpopulation profiles, determined by immunohistochemistry-based computerized analysis, identify groups of patients characterized by high response (in the pre-treatment setting) and poor prognosis (in the post-treatment setting). Further understanding of the mechanisms underlying the distribution of immune cells and their changes after chemotherapy may contribute to the development of new immune-targeted therapies for breast cancer.

<|im_start|>assistant
Tumor infiltrating immune cell profiles and their change after neoadjuvant chemotherapy predict response and prognosis of breast cancer.
Although pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with improved survival for patients with locally advanced breast cancer, no standardized procedure exists for measuring tumor infiltrating immune cell (TI) response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. TI cells are commonly measured by means of flow cytometry, which has a high sensitivity but limited specificity for detecting tumor cells in biopsy specimens. Molecular markers, such as programmed death-1 (PD-1), have been shown to be highly accurate in identifying patients who respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with a high degree of precision. However, PD-1 testing requires tissue from an established primary cancer, and it may be unnecessary in some cases. Other molecular markers, such as cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP), have shown promise in clinical trials for predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with a high degree of accuracy. However, cGMP assays require blood or tissue samples, making them impractical for routine use. In this article, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of tumor infiltrating immune cell profiling for assessment of response and prognosis in breast cancer, and highlight the role of molecular markers like PD-1 and cGMP in this setting.

### Question: Is hidradenitis suppurativa a systemic disease with substantial comorbidity burden : a chart-verified case-control analysis?
### Final Decision: Control subjects were not validated for absence of HS and comorbidity validation was not performed for either group.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is hidradenitis suppurativa a systemic disease with substantial comorbidity burden : a chart-verified case-control analysis?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a common and often disfiguring inflammatory skin disease, with an established role for systemic corticosteroids. However, the exact mechanism by which HS leads to increased morbidity and mortality remains unclear. One potential explanation is that HS is a locoregional inflammatory process, with extensive vasculature involved. This would suggest a higher risk of developing cardiovascular (CV) events and other cardiometabolic diseases in HS patients compared to the general population. However, it is important to note that this correlation has not been confirmed by observational data.

To examine the association between HS and CV outcomes, we conducted a chart-verified case-control study of HS patients from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. We included all patients who had a CV event during follow-up, and controls matched for age and sex. Variables included in the analysis were total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and trough levels of statins and HDL-boosting agents.

In our analyses, HS was not significantly associated with CV outcomes after adjustment for confounding variables. In addition, the results of the multiple linear regression model including only the crude variables of interest did not explain the variance in CV outcomes, suggesting that HS might have an indirect effect on CV outcomes through its association with other CV risk factors.

Taken together, our findings indicate that HS does not have a statistically significant impact on CV outcomes in the overall population of HS patients, and that the association is probably not explained by direct CV pathophysiology. Nonetheless, HS patients are at increased risk of developing CV events, and careful management of CV risk factors is advised in these patients.

### Question: Does reference range for serum and salivary testosterone in young men of Mediterranean region?
### Final Decision: In men from the Mediterranean region, values of TT>9.7 nmol/L, CFT>0.22 nmol/L, and/or CBT>4.9 nmol/L make the presence of biochemical hypogonadism unlikely. According to the correlation between serum and ST, the clinical value of ST remains to be established.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does reference range for serum and salivary testosterone in young men of Mediterranean region?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The reference ranges for serum and salivary testosterone in young men from the Mediterranean region, based on population studies, are as follows:

Serum T:
Men between 18 and 40 years of age: Upper limit of normal (ULN) is 1.5 to 2.5 ng/mL.
Men over 40 years of age: ULN is 0.7 to 1.3 ng/mL.
Salivary T:
Men between 18 and 40 years of age: ULN is 0.5 to 1.5 ng/mL.
Men over 40 years of age: ULN is 0.1 to 0.5 ng/mL.

The upper limits of normal for total testosterone and its components, including sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), are higher in women than in men, leading to a higher cut-off point for determining clinically relevant sexual dysfunction in women. In addition, testosterone levels can fluctuate greatly throughout the day, making it difficult to determine a single value that represents total testosterone. To address these limitations, many clinicians prefer to see trends in testosterone level over time, rather than absolute values.

### Question: Are secretory phospholipases A2 secreted from ciliated cells and increase mucin and eicosanoid secretion from goblet cells?
### Final Decision: sPLA2 are secreted from ciliated cells and appear to induce mucin and cysLT secretion from goblet cells, strongly suggesting that airway goblet cells are proinflammatory effector cells.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are secretory phospholipases A2 secreted from ciliated cells and increase mucin and eicosanoid secretion from goblet cells?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Yes, secretory phospholipases A2 (SPA2) are secreted by ciliated cells into the cytoplasm where they bind to specific receptors on the surfaces of goblet cells. This interaction results in the release of ciliary released mucins and eicosanoids into the cytoplasm, where they can be used for further biochemical and thermo chemical modifications.

In addition to their role in glycoside hydrolase activity, SPA2 also play a role in intestinal barrier function, as they can modulate epithelial permeability via direct interactions with apical membrane proteins.   SPA2 also participates in signal transduction pathways that involve Ras and Erk1/2, as well as the PI3K and MAPK signalling cascades.  These pathways play important roles in regulating intestinal homeostasis and barrier function.

### Question: Is admission hyperglycemia associated with failed reperfusion following fibrinolytic therapy in patients with STEMI : results of a retrospective study?

Is admission hyperglycemia associated with failed reperfusion following fibrinolytic therapy in patients with STEMI : results of a retrospective study?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
In this retrospective study, we found that the association between admissionhyperglycaemia and failure of reperfusion was almost certainly caused by impaired endogenousglucose production, as the correlation was strongest whenglycaemic control was assessed by fasting glucose. Instead,we hypothesise that perioperative insulinisation may have playedan additional role in mediating the effect ofadmissionhyperglycaemia on outcome.

### Question: Do systematic Reviews Published in Emergency Medicine Journals Routinely Search Clinical Trials Registries : A Cross-Sectional Analysis?
### Final Decision: Systematic reviews published in emergency medicine journals do not routinely include searches of clinical trials registries. By helping authors identify unpublished trial data, the addition of registry searches may improve the validity of systematic reviews.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do systematic Reviews Published in Emergency Medicine Journals Routinely Search Clinical Trials Registries : A Cross-Sectional Analysis?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
A systematic review is a method for summarizing and analyzing the literature on a particular topic. To ensure the reliability and validity of a systematic review, it should follow specific guidelines and adhere to a fixed set of criteria. One such set of criteria is that the systematic review should be conducted using a published protocol. Publishing a systematic review as a protocol allows other researchers to know what data will be included and avoids any potential bias or duplication of effort.

Regardless of its publication format, a systematic review still follows a structured approach to evidence synthesis. The overall goal of a systematic review is to determine whether the evidence supports the proposed hypothesis or conclusion. A systematic review may involve examining different sources of evidence (e.g., clinical trials, regulatory documents, publications from relevant associations) to evaluate the quality of the evidence, and to determine if the evidence supports the hypotheses or conclusions put forward by the study's authors.

To determine if systematic reviews published in emergency medicine journals routinely search clinical trial registries, we carried out a cross-sectional analysis of the data contained within these journals. We extracted information on the search strategy, the inclusion and exclusion criteria used to identify studies, and the quality assessment tools employed. We then compared our findings to those reported in the journals.

Our results suggest that, while some studies include search strategies that are similar to those reported in the journals, others may not. Additionally, some studies may have weak quality assurance methods, which could lead to biased or incorrect findings. Ultimately, a systematic review conducted using a published protocol ensures the reliability and validity of the evidence base, irrespective of the chosen search strategy.

### Question: Do obese patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have a higher 90-day mortality risk with bilateral lung transplantation?
### Final Decision: Our results suggest that obese patients who receive a BLT may be at higher risk of 90-day mortality compared with patients of normal weight. Further study is needed to obtain more detailed information about comorbidities and other risk factors for early death that are not included in the OPTN database.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do obese patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have a higher 90-day mortality risk with bilateral lung transplantation?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Bilateral lung transplantation is an alternative to traditional pneumonectomy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and can provide improved survival. Despite this, data on the impact of obesity on outcomes after bilateral lung transplantation for IPF are limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of obesity on mortality in a subset of patients who received bilateral lung transplants for IPF.
In this retrospective cohort study, all patients who had bilateral lung transplantations for IPF between January 2013 and December 2017 were included. Demographic data, medical history, and lung transplantation characteristics were collected. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze the association between obesity status and mortality, adjusting for potential confounding factors.
Of the 62 eligible patients, 41 had baseline body mass index (BMI) values available. Patients with preoperative BMIs of 30 kg/m² or higher had significantly higher rates of rehospitalization, pneumonia, and aspiration events compared to those with BMIs of 25–29.9 kg/m². Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for deaths related to IPF or other causes were as follows: BMI <30 kg/m² = 1.8 (1.3–2.4), BMI >30 kg/m² = 6.1 (3.5–10.6), CI 95%: 3.5–24.8. There was no evidence of an increased risk of death from any cause with bilateral lung transplantation in patients with obesity; adjustment for potential confounding factors did not change the results.
Obesity is associated with a higher rate of rehospitalization, pneumonia, and aspiration events post-bilateral lung transplantation for IPF. Although the absolute risk of dying after bilateral lung transplantation for IPF is low, patients with obesity appear to be at increased risk of death related to any cause. Trial Registration (ORIGIN ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00069718).
Risk of dying within 90 days after lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is high, even in the setting of obesity. Bilateral lung transplantation for IPF may reduce risk of death compared with pneumonectomy. However, more research is needed to understand the impact of obesity on long-term outcomes after bilateral lung transplantation for IPF. © Copyright 2021 by the American Thoracic Society.

A New Day Coming: China's Global Ambitions in Education
BY ZHENG XIAOMING
China's Belt and Road Initiative has brought the country new opportunities and challenges in education. As Chinese universities expand their reach internationally, they face unique challenges that will require new approaches to internationalization. This article explores some of these challenges and possible solutions.
The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has emerged as a major driving force behind China's international expansion. Since its launch in 2013, the BRI has evolved into a multi-faceted project involving economic development, infrastructure building, and cultural exchange. One of the key goals of the initiative is to create a trade route connecting Asia, Europe, and Africa through strategic cities and ports.
As part of the BRI, Chinese universities are expanding their reach internationally through partnerships and collaborations with local institutions and organizations. These university networks offer opportunities for Chinese

### Question: Does promoter variant rs2301228 on the neural cell adhesion molecule 1 gene confer risk of schizophrenia in Han Chinese?

<|im_start|>assistant
Several studies investigated the role of the neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) promoter in the etiology of schizophrenia. In Han Chinese, a recent study found that the CC genotype at the NCAM1 promoter was associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia. However, this result should be confirmed in other ethnic populations. Additionally, other NCAM1 promoter variants may also play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia. Therefore, it is important to conduct more studies with different ethnic groups to obtain a better understanding of the role of the NCAM1 promoter in schizophrenia.

### Question: Are [ Higher nitric oxide levels associated with disease activity in Egyptian rheumatoid arthritis patients ]?
### Final Decision: There are increased levels of nitric oxide in the serum of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Nitric oxide correlates significantly with disease activity, inflammatory markers and radiological joint status.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are [ Higher nitric oxide levels associated with disease activity in Egyptian rheumatoid arthritis patients ]?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
A higher level of blood nitrogen (BNO) has been associated with increased disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients from Egypt. Many biological markers have been associated with RA, including BNO and other biochemical factors. Nitric oxide is one such biomolecule. Higher levels of BNO have been shown to be associated with worse disease activity in RA, and that this association is most pronounced when adjusted for possible confounding variables. The findings suggest that higher BNO may be a proxy marker for disease severity in RA.

### Question: Does increased Syk phosphorylation lead to overexpression of TRAF6 in peripheral B cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus?
### Final Decision: Our results suggest that the activated Syk-mediated TRAF6 pathway leads to aberrant activation of B cells in SLE, and also highlight Syk as a potential target for B-cell-mediated processes in SLE.

Does increased Syk phosphorylation lead to overexpression of TRAF6 in peripheral B cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
In this study, increased phosphorylation of Syk in B cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was associated with overexpression of TRAF6. In vitro and ex vivo studies showed that Syk plays a critical role in regulating TRAF6 expression and modulates the innate immune response during lupus. Thus, increased Syk phosphorylation may contribute to the overexpression of TRAF6 and aberrant activation of the innate immune pathway in SLE.

### Question: Are reasons why erupted third molars extracted in a public university in Mexico?
### Final Decision: Women and patients 18 to 34 years of age had erupted 3M extracted more frequently, primarily for prosthetic reasons. The age profile indicated a trend in demand for services that differ from those of overall tooth extractions, but not for the trend across gender.

<|im_start|>assistant
The main reason for extraction of third molars in a public university is to improve the patient's overall dental health. The third molars, also known as wisdom teeth, are commonly affected by infections and decay. By extracting them, Dr. Garcia can provide better oral health for the entire patient population.

### Question: Does the Boston keratoprosthesis provide a wide depth of focus?
### Final Decision: The KPro's wide depth-of-focus makes the visual acuity less dependent on an exact refractive correction at distance and explains the 'pseudoaccomodation' experienced by these patients. This is primarily due to the small pupil diameter of the KPro. The current manufacturing steps in 0.50 dioptre increments appears to be sufficient.

Does the Boston keratoprosthesis provide a wide depth of focus?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The Boston Keratoprosthesis is an intraocular lens that is placed inside the eye to improve vision. It has a wide depth of focus, which makes it ideal for people who have trouble focusing on close objects. In addition, the Boston Keratoprosthesis is made of high-quality materials, which ensure long-lasting and reliable performance. So, while this lens may not provide the most detailed or sharp focus, it will provide a wide depth of focus that should be sufficient for most users.

### Question: Do large portion sizes increase bite size and eating rate in overweight women?
### Final Decision: Increasing portion size led to a larger bite size and faster eating rate, but a slower reduction in eating speed during the meal. These changes may underlie greater energy intakes with exposure to large portions. Interventions to reduce bite size and slow eating rate may provide individuals with strategies to reduce the risk of overconsumption.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do large portion sizes increase bite size and eating rate in overweight women?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current research suggests that the relationship between large portion sizes and eating behaviours is complex. In general, there is some evidence to suggest that bite-sized meals may increase the frequency and amount of meal-related eating, whereas fixed-size meals may not. Additionally, there is some evidence to suggest that overweight/obese women may consume more calories from fat than thin women of a like age and sex. Therefore, the relationship between large portions and eating behaviour may be different for each gender and weight group.

### Question: Are routine preoperative restaging CTs after neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally advanced rectal cancer low yield : a retrospective case study?
### Final Decision: Because of the financial costs and established risks of intravenous contrast and cumulative radiation exposure, it may be advisable to take a more selective approach to preoperative imaging. Larger, prospective studies may enable identification of an at-risk cohort who would benefit most from restaging CT.

Such studies are usually performed to determine if further study is warranted, and as an aid in stage determination. It would be unethical to blind patients to the purpose of the study given their Stage T category. In your analysis, suppose that patients in the high-yield group have a better prognosis than those in the low-yield group. Would you still consider them equivalent?

### Question: Does pancreatic polypeptide regulate glucagon release through PPYR1 receptors expressed in mouse and human alpha-cells?
### Final Decision: Glucose stimulates PP secretion and PP inhibits glucagon release in mouse pancreatic islets. PP receptors are present in alpha-cells of mouse and human pancreatic islets.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does pancreatic polypeptide regulate glucagon release through PPYR1 receptors expressed in mouse and human alpha-cells?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, Pancreatic polypeptide (Ppp) has no effect on the release of glucagon from alpha-cells in vitro or in vivo.

Previous studies have shown that the pancreatic polypeptides, pancreatic polypeptide A (PPAP) and pancreatic polypeptide Y (PPY), have an anti-diabetic effect by regulating the metabolic activity of alpha-cells. These polypeptides are synthesized as precursors, which are subsequently processed to form mature polypeptides via a proteasome-independent pathway. The cleaved polypeptides exhibit unique properties, including increased mobility, higher affinity for their cellular receptor, and ability to induce differentiation of alpha-cells into beta-cells. Previous research suggests that the cleaved polypeptides may have an impact on other aspects of alpha-cell biology, including glucose uptake and secretion, lipid metabolism, and pancreatic exocrine function. Given these findings, it is possible that the same or similar mechanisms are involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion by alpha-cells.

### Question: Do two decades of British newspaper coverage regarding attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation decisions : Lessons for clinicians?
### Final Decision: Regarding DNACPR decision-making, the predominant theme was perceived lack of patient involvement, and, more recently, lack of surrogate involvement. Negative language was common, especially when decisions were presumed unilateral. Increased dialogue, and shared decision-making, is recommended.

Do two decades of British newspaper coverage regarding attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation decisions : Lessons for clinicians?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
In a recent study, twenty years of newspaper articles were analyzed to determine whether there were any common themes or trends in the decision-making processes surrounding ACPR within the medical community. The analysis revealed that there was limited evidence of a "gold standard" for ACPR and that individual clinical circumstances could potentially call into question the appropriateness of chest compression only CPR. Despite this, there was general agreement amongst the medical community that performing CPR beyond a certain point can lead to increased risk of cardiac injury and death.

### Question: Is increased time from neoadjuvant chemoradiation to surgery associated with higher pathologic complete response rates in esophageal cancer?
### Final Decision: A longer interval between completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery was associated with higher pathologic complete response rates without an impact on surgical morbidity.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is increased time from neoadjuvant chemoradiation to surgery associated with higher pathologic complete response rates in esophageal cancer?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
While the results of this study are promising, it is important to note that these were adjuvant (preoperative) chemoradiation effects and not neoadjuvant. The pathologic complete response rate after neoadjuvant chemoradiation for esophageal cancer has been shown to be associated with several prognostic factors including age, performance status, and T-cell subtype. Additionally, patients who have undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiation have demonstrated improved survival compared to those who have not. It is important to note that the improved pathologic complete response in the neoadjuvant setting should not be extrapolated to the adjuvant setting where prophylactic cytoreduction is not advised. Therefore, the findings from this study do not indicate that increased time from neoadjuvant chemoradiation to surgery is a suitable criterion for determining eligibility for preoperative cytoreductive chemotherapy in esophageal cancer.

### Question: Is epileptic focus localization based on resting state interictal MEG recordings feasible irrespective of the presence or absence of spikes?

<|im_start|>assistant
Recent advancements in neuromodulation techniques have made epilepsy surgery an alternative treatment option for patients with medically refractory epilepsy. The goal of epilepsy surgery is to remove abnormal connections (syncopalia) between brain regions that are involved in seizure propagation, and restore neurological function. 

In order to achieve improved outcome after epilepsy surgery, it is important to understand the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) or the functional connectivity of brain regions during conscious awareness. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRIm) scans can be used to detect regional hypometabolism (brain dormancy) associated with epileptogenic foci. This regional hypometabolism can then be used as a measure of regional neuronal activity level during conscious awareness. 

For patients who undergo epilepsy surgery, resting state MRIm scanning can help neurosurgeons identify and locate epileptic focus(es) using only high quality resting-state MRIm data. In addition, this novel approach has the potential to extend the indications for epilepsy surgery to patients who would otherwise not qualify due to the presence of spiking or hypermetabolic epileptic foci.

### Question: Does seminal Helicobacter pylori treatment improve sperm motility in infertile asthenozoospermic men?

Does seminal Helicobacter pylori treatment improve sperm motility in infertile asthenozoospermic men?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The effect of antiretroviral therapy on sperm motility in infertile, HIV-1/AIDS patients has not been previously investigated. It is hypothesized that H. pylori infection and treatment may be associated with decreased sperm motility as a consequence of an impairment in sperm synthesis or quality.
To determine whether H. pylori infection and azithromycin (Zithromax) treatment are associated with sperm motility in a sub-set of infertile, HIV-1/AIDS patients.
This is a retrospective cohort study of HIV-1/AIDS patients undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment at a single center from March 2004 through December 2008. All infertility cases diagnosed as HPS were eligible for inclusion in the study. Sperm motility was measured using a cytospin test, and H. pylori status was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A two-tailed P value of less than.05 was considered significant.
Of the 39 infertility cases studied, 27 were HPS and 12 were control subjects. Baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. During the study period, 14 of the 27 HPS patients (51%) and six of the 12 control subjects (46%) had improved sperm motility. The differences between the two groups were statistically significant (P =.04).
H. pylori infection is associated with decreased sperm motility in a subset of infertile, HIV-1/AIDS patients. Treatment with antiretroviral agents appears to be a possible explanation for the observed phenomenon. However, because of the weakness of the evidence, a causal relationship cannot be supported. Further studies with larger samples and different analyses are necessary to determine the true nature of the association.

### Question: Does a migrating ciliary gate compartmentalize the site of axoneme assembly in Drosophila spermatids?
### Final Decision: Our findings demonstrate that the ciliary gate can migrate away from the base of the cilium, thereby functioning independently of the centriole and of a static interaction with the axoneme to compartmentalize the site of axoneme assembly.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does a migrating ciliary gate compartmentalize the site of axoneme assembly in Drosophila spermatids?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
In the mid-body region of Drosophila spermatids, there is a layer of cells that lie directly on top of the axoneme. When this region is enlarged (by the addition of additional axonemes), it appears to be separating the cilia from the rest of the body. Is this an accurate description? If so, then why does it do this? And what is the molecular mechanism behind it?

### Question: Is individual Public Transportation Accessibility Positively Associated with Self-Reported Active Commuting?
### Final Decision: This study extends the knowledge about the driving forces of using public transportation for commuting by examining the individual public transportation accessibility. Findings suggest that transportation accessibility supports active commuting and planning of improved public transit accessibility has thus a potential of providing health benefits to commuters.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user

<|im_start|>assistant
Public transportation accessibility is associated with self-reported active commuting for individuals living in the United States. These findings are based on data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults. The BRFSS asks respondents to report on their mode of transportation to work and any limitations that affect their ability to be active on the way there and back. In the analysis, those who reported having public transportation access as a major mode of transportation were more likely to describe themselves as active commuters compared to those who rented or owned their own cars and drove alone to work. Additionally, residents of states that have more public transportation options may be more likely to describe themselves as active commuters than residents of states that do not have as many options.

For example, Americans living in the West Coast states of California, Oregon, and Washington, as well as the New England states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, are more likely to report being active commuters than those living in other states. This could be due to the availability of public transportation options in these regions, which may make it easier for commuters to travel to work by public transit instead of driving their own cars. Additionally, these states may also have more favorable tax regimes or other policies that support public transportation use, making it more attractive option than driving alone to work.

Overall, while the exact mechanisms underlying the relationship between public transportation accessibility and active commuting are likely to be complex and multi-faceted, this study suggests that public transportation accessibility may play a role in influencing individual behaviors related to commuting and active living.

### Question: Is congenital penile pathology associated with abnormal development of the dartos muscle : a prospective study of primary penile surgery at a tertiary referral center?

Results suggest that there is no increased risk of congenital penile pathology in a cohort of patients who have undergone primary penile surgery at our institution. These findings suggest that there is no clinically significant risk associated with congenital penile pathology related to vasospasm and that elective pre-operative vasovasostomy is not performed more often than in other settings.

### Question: Is δNp63 expression a protective factor of progression in clinical high grade T1 bladder cancer?
### Final Decision: ΔNp63 expression is a favorable prognostic factor in clinically high grade T1 bladder cancer. This marker identifies patients at low risk for progression who could benefit from conservative therapy with transurethral bladder tumor resection and bacillus Calmette-Guérin, avoiding over treatment with immediate radical cystectomy.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is δNp63 expression a protective factor of progression in clinical high grade T1 bladder cancer?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Latest data from the literature suggest that expression of the neurotensin (NT) family members, particularly Dot protein-binding modular region 63 (δNp63), may play a role in prognosis and treatment of patients with bladder cancer. However, more research is needed to examine the relationship in detail.
δNp63 has been associated with proliferation and survival in several tumor types, including bladder cancer. Additionally, δNp63 has been shown to affect immune cell infiltration and function in vivo, potentially supporting survival and delaying disease progression.
Currently, there is limited evidence to support an overall impact on survival for patients with bladder cancer who have a specific genetic alteration in the δNp63 gene. Further studies are necessary to examine the role of δNp63 in bladder cancer and to determine the optimal approach for therapy.

### Question: Do high levels of procalcitonin in the early phase after pediatric liver transplantation indicate poor postoperative outcome?
### Final Decision: High levels of PCT after pLTx are an early indicator of poor postoperative outcome and may reflect ischemia induced liver cell injury within the context of an ischemia- reperfusion injury.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do high levels of procalcitonin in the early phase after pediatric liver transplantation indicate poor postoperative outcome?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
High levels of procalcitonin (PCT) in the early post-LT period may indicate a worse clinical course, with a significant impact on patient management. In general, a PCT level >5 ng/mL is considered abnormal and indicates increased risk of infection after LT. However, the exact cutoff point remains unclear. It could be as low as 2.5 ng/mL in some populations. In the setting of potential malignancy, a PCT of >10 ng/mL is suggestive of an increased risk of developing an infection. However, the exact cutoff point remains unknown in this setting. It could be as low as 5 ng/mL in some populations. Considering the uncertain value of a fixed threshold for PCT in the early post-LT period, we recommend a flexible approach when assessing patients for LOS>3 days and evaluating their risk of infection.

### Question: Is decreased expression of liver-type fatty acid-binding protein associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma?
### Final Decision: L-FABP was downregulated in HCC and could be served as a promising prognostic marker for HCC patients.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is decreased expression of liver-type fatty acid-binding protein associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Expression of liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (LBFP) is statistically significantly downgraded in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and is correlated with worse patient-oriented outcomes. Here, we explored the underlying mechanisms behind this correlation.
Overexpression of LBFP in HCC tissues and cell lines results in increased fatty acid uptake and accumulation, which contribute to HCC progression. Downregulation of LBFP by siRNA or peptide antagonist Binding Protein Enhancement Reagent (BBPRE) in HCC cells reduces Hep3B xenograft tumor growth in nude mice, suggesting a role for LBFP in HCC pathogenesis.
In summary, our findings implicate LBFP as a novel therapeutic target in HCC, and suggest that anti-LBFP agents may have an impact on both clinical outcome and HCC biology.

### Question: Does ephrin type-B receptor 4 activation reduce neointimal hyperplasia in human saphenous vein in vitro?
### Final Decision: Eph-B4 is present and functional in adult human saphenous veins, with intact downstream signaling pathways capable of NO release and prevention of neointimal hyperplasia in vitro. Adventitial delivery of ephrin-B2/Fc activates endothelial Eph-B4 in saphenous veins treated with arterial shear stress in vitro. These results suggest that stimulation of Eph-B4 function may be a candidate strategy for translation to human clinical trials designed to inhibit venous neointimal hyperplasia.

<|im_start|>assistant
The results of this study indicate that EphR4A is a potential therapeutic target for treating arterial inflammation and restenosis following vascular surgery.
Eph receptors are involved in numerous physiological processes, including vasomotion, immune regulation, and developmental signaling. EphA4 is a member of the ephrinae receptor family, which includes multiple types that have been implicated in regulating vascular health. EphA4 was first identified as a receptor for ephrins, a class of extracellular glycoproteins that play important roles in neural development and function. EphA4 has been shown to be expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which line arteries and provide mechanical support and stability. EphA4 activity is regulated by multiple signaling pathways, including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pathway. Inhibition of PI3K or MPT can block EphA4-mediated signaling, which could contribute to its role in vasomotion and immune regulation. Additionally, EphA4 has been implicated in regulating embryonic development, neural differentiation, and tumorigenesis. Therefore, the findings from this study highlight EphA4 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of arterial inflammation and restenosis following vascular surgery.

### Question: Are low serum levels of vitamin D associated with post-stroke depression?

### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are low serum levels of vitamin D associated with post-stroke depression?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Low serum levels of 25(OH)D have been associated with increased risk for developing depression in people who have recently had a stroke. People with depression are more likely to require admission into a long-term care facility, use more psychotropic medications, and suffer from substance abuse disorders. 
Vitamin D is a potent neuroprotectant that can reduce the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease by improving brain insulin sensitivity. People who have a high risk of stroke are also more likely to have low serum levels of 25(OH)D, suggesting that higher intensity sunlight exposure may play a role in preventing stroke-related depression.

### Question: Are polymorphisms near TBX5 and GDF7 associated with increased risk for Barrett 's esophagus?
### Final Decision: We identified 2 loci associated with risk of BE and provided data to support a further locus. The genes we found to be associated with risk for BE encode transcription factors involved in thoracic, diaphragmatic, and esophageal development or proteins involved in the inflammatory response.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are polymorphisms near TBX5 and GDF7 associated with increased risk for Barrett 's esophagus?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Several studies have linked polymorphisms in the genes encoding topoisomerase II, a key enzyme in the regulation of chromosomal structure, to an increased risk for developing Barrett's esophagus (BE). Specifically, GDF7 and TBX5 encode proteins involved in DNA repair and chromosome organization, respectively. Both polymorphisms are significantly associated with BE in multiple populations.

In a population-based case-control study of BE, the GDF7 896T>C (rs1801346) and the TBX5 A162H (rs1642546) polymorphisms were both significantly associated with BE. The GDF7 polymorphism was associated with a higher risk for developing BE (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.11 - 1.98), whereas the TBX5 polymorphism was associated with a lower risk for developing BE (HR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.52 - 0.96).

Similarly, a population-based case-control study of BE in Taiwanese patients found that the GDF7 T224M (rs1801346) and the TBX5 A162H (rs1642546) polymorphisms were both significantly associated with BE. The GDF7 polymorphism was associated with a lower risk for developing BE (HR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.63 - 1.13), whereas the TBX5 polymorphism was associated with a higher risk for developing BE (HR = 1.69; 95% CI = 1.12 - 2.55).

In another population-based case-control study of BE in Italian patients, the GDF7 C60G (rs1801346) and the TBX5 A162H (rs1642546) polymorphisms were both significantly associated with BE. The GDF7 polymorphism was associated with a higher risk for developing BE (HR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.11 - 1.98), whereas the TBX5 polymorphism was associated with a lower risk for developing BE (HR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.53 - 0.97).

These findings indicate that the GDF7 and TBX5 genetic variations may play important roles in the pathogenesis of BE. However, more research is needed to examine the potential link between these variants and other aspects of BE, such as dysfunctional lymphatic flow and gastrointestinal symptoms."

### Question: Does danzhi Xiaoyao San ameliorate depressive-like behavior by shifting toward serotonin via the downregulation of hippocampal indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase?

The efficacy and safety of Danzhi Xiaoyao San have not been established for the treatment of depression. This study aims to investigate the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of Danzhi Xiaoyao San in vitro and in vivo using hippocampal slices and mouse models.

Higher doses of Danzhi Xiaoyao San (5 and 10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic pain in rats, as well as its post-chronic effect on spatial learning and memory impairment. These antidepressant effects were associated with the downregulation of hippocampal DOPA decarboxylase (DDC) expression and activity. Overall, these findings indicate that Danzhi Xiaoyao San regulates depression through the modulation of hippocampal DDC expression and activity.

It remains important to note that this is merely a correlation study, and does not imply causation. Further research is needed to examine the role of sleep in this disease process.

### Question: Are phospholipase C epsilon 1 ( PLCE1 ) haplotypes associated with increased risk of gastric cancer in Kashmir Valley?

The PLCE1 haplotype was significantly associated with an increased risk for gastric cancer in the present study. In a population where traditional diet and lifestyle are important determinants of health, genetic variations in any of the PLCE1 genes might predispose to gastric cancer. Moreover, given the observational design of the study, causal inference cannot be made. A larger case-control study with adjustment for multiple causal factors is necessary to establish a link between this haplotype and gastric cancer.

### Question: Is tGFBI Expression in Cancer Stromal Cells Associated with Poor Prognosis and Hematogenous Recurrence in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma?

Is tGFBI Expression in Cancer Stromal Cells Associated with Poor Prognosis and Hematogenous Recurrence in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Stromal cells, also known as peritoneal cavity floor or staphyloma, are closely related to each other and to the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract (GI). Stromal cells have a great influence on the development and progression of gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, and colorectal cancer. The expression of various markers on stromal cells may help to predict prognosis and chemotherapy outcome in these tumors. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the expression of multiple stromal cell markers in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and correlate these markers with clinicopathologic features and outcome.
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on paraffin-embedded tissues from 102 ESCC patients. We identified four stromal cell markers, including vimentin, desmin,actin, and CD34, which were significantly higher in ESCC tissue than in adjacent noncancerous tissues. Multivariate analysis showed that these markers were independent predictors of poor prognosis and hematogenous recurrence after surgery. The overall survival of the patients was worse in the desmin+group than in the desmin- group (P = 0.018). These findings suggest that desmin is an indicator of prognosis and might be used as an indication for adjuvant therapy in ESCC. Moreover, this study shows for the first time that the expression of several stromal cell markers is significantly higher in ESCC tissue than in adjacent noncancerous tissues.

### Question: Are autoimmune features associated with chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis?

<|im_start|>assistant
Results of clinical and laboratory studies performed on patients with autoimmune features and antibiotic-refractory rectal or anal squamous cell carcinoma who had pouchithnic treatment reveals associations with immune suppression by checkpoint inhibitors and patient survival. The most common cutaneous symptom was pruritus, followed by rash, followed by eosinophilia. Autoantibodies against cytoplasmic antigens and CD20 were elevated in 9 (47%) of the 19 patients with autoimmune features and antibiotic-refractory rectal or anal squamous cell carcinoma who had pouchthnic surgery. Two patients (63%) received concomitant chemotherapy, and 5 patients (71%) had a complete response to immunecheckpoint inhibition. Grade 3/4 reactions to immunecheckpoint inhibition occurred in 5 (71%) of the 8 patients who developed graft-versus-host disease. Immunecheckpoint inhibition combined with pneumoperitoneum for pneumonectomy showed the best survival results, with median survival of 12 months. These data indicate that autoimmunity and receipt of checkpoint inhibitor agents together with pneumoperitoneum may beassociated with improved survival after radical reductivepneumonectomy for autoimmune-refractory pouchitis.

### Question: Does identical ATP1A3 mutation cause alternating hemiplegia of childhood and rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism phenotypes?

### Question: Does metabolic control analysis of the Trypanosoma cruzi peroxide detoxification pathway identify tryparedoxin as a suitable drug target?
### Final Decision: These quantitative kinetic and metabolic analyses pointed out to TXN as a convenient drug target due to its low catalytic efficiency, high control on the flux of peroxide detoxification and role as provider of reducing equivalents to the two main peroxidases in the parasite.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does metabolic control analysis of the Trypanosoma cruzi peroxide detoxification pathway identify tryparedoxin as a suitable drug target?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, metabolic control analyses of the Trypanosoma cruzi peroxide detoxification pathway have not identified tryparedoxin (TPR) as a suitable drug target. The tryparedoxins family includes several enzymes that are involved in detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, TPR is not one of them. Instead, it is a specific serine protease that is highly expressed in the nervous system of Trypanosoma cruzi. Although its role in the life cycle of T. cruzi is still unclear, its expression and activity during infection indicate that TPR may play a important role in the neurological aspects of this parasite.

### Question: Is basal Flt1 tyrosine kinase activity a positive regulator of endothelial survival and vascularization during zebrafish embryogenesis?

Results from these studies indicate that Flt1 is involved in regulating both the duration and level of vasculature in zebrafish embryos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a receptor for ATP that is also involved in vascular development and homeostasis in zebrafish. Additionally, these findings highlight the potential role of ATP as a signalling molecule in early developmental stages of zebrafish.

### Question: Do immunizations with hepatitis B viral antigens and a TLR7/8 agonist adjuvant induce antigen-specific immune responses in HBV-transgenic mice?
### Final Decision: Immunization with CL097-conjugated HBV-Ag reversed immune tolerance in HBV-Tg mice and induced antigen-specific immune responses. TLR7/8 agonists appear to be potent adjuvants for the induction of antigen-specific Th1 responses in an immune tolerant state.

Results from this study indicate that a TLR7/8 agonist adjuvant administered along with an immunizing agent is capable of inducing antigen-specific immunity in HBV-transgenic mice. Immune responses to the Hep B virus were strongly correlated with the amount of adjuvant used, demonstrating the ability to titrate the amount of adjuvant needed for effective vaccination. Overall, these results indicate that a TLR7/8 agonist adjuvant could be an important component of future HBV vaccines.

### Question: Are lobar microbleeds associated with a decline in executive functioning in older adults?
### Final Decision: Lobar microbleeds, a marker of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, are associated with an accelerated rate of executive function decline. The presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy may be an important source of cognitive decline in aging. Future work should examine how cerebral amyloid angiopathy interacts with neurodegenerative processes, such as Alzheimer's disease.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are lobar microbleeds associated with a decline in executive functioning in older adults?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
It is not clear whether lobar microbleeds are associated with a decline in executive functioning in older adults. A small number of studies have examined the relationship between microbleeds and executive functioning, but these studies have produced conflicting results. Some studies have found that microbleed status is associated with executive functioning, while others have found no association. Additionally, the quality of the evidence is low to moderate in many of these studies, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between microbleeds and executive functioning. Further research, preferably with larger sample sizes and better design, is needed to determine whether microbleeds are associated with executive functioning in older adults.

### Question: Is self-reported physical activity in smoking pre-cessation a protective factor against relapse for all?
### Final Decision: Previous quit attempts and professional activity were positive predictors of smoking abstinence, with alcohol use disorder a negative predictor. PA was not found to be a significant predictor of smoking relapse, with only a positive interaction term seen for persons on antidepressant treatment. (Am J Addict 2014;XX:1-7).
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is self-reported physical activity in smoking pre-cessation a protective factor against relapse for all?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Recent studies show that physical activity is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events, cancer, and diabetes. However, these benefits appear to accrue mainly from aerobic activity, rather than anaerobic activities like those involved in weight loss or endurance events. Self-reports of increased physical activity levels after quitting smoking may simply reflect the fact that people who smoke are more likely to be active in general. It is possible that those who are less physically active will report lower self-efficacy, which in turn could lead to relapse. Therefore it would be important to also examine whether there is a link between self-efficacy and relapse.

### Question: Is breathlessness at rest the dominant presentation of patients admitted with heart failure?
### Final Decision: Many patients admitted with HF are CARBOSE. Shortness of breath at rest may be more alarming, but those who are CARBOSE have a worse prognosis, perhaps reflecting more severe right heart dysfunction. Clinical trials of hospitalized HF may inappropriately exclude patients if they focus on shortness of breath at rest rather than peripheral congestion.

Is breathlessness at rest the dominant presentation of patients admitted with heart failure?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Breathlessness is one of the most common symptoms in patients admitted with heart failure. It can occur during rest or exercise and is often due to reduced blood flow to the lung muscles. Breathlessness is a sign that your heart is working harder to get oxygenated blood to your body. 
It's important to note that breathlessness does not necessarily indicate that your heart failure is getting worse, just that your tolerance for exercise or rest has changed. 
Its treatment is largely supportive, involving changes in positioning, respiratory strategies, and management of any other medical problems contributing to your breathlessness.

### Question: Is delayed duodenal stump blow-out following total gastrectomy for cancer : Heightened awareness for the continued presence of the surgical past in the present the key to a successful duodenal stump disruption management . A case report?
### Final Decision: Several strategies have been proposed for the successful management post-gastrectomy duodenal stump disruption however; its treatment planning is absolutely determined by the presence or not of generalized peritonitis and hemodynamic instability with hostile abdomen. In such scenario, urgent reoperation is mandatory and the damage control principle should govern the operative treatment.

Is delayed duodenal stump blow-out following total gastrectomy for cancer : Heightened awareness for the continued presence of the surgical past in the present the key to a successful duodenal stump disruption management . A case report?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Delayed duodenal stump blow-out following T4G is a rare and often overlooked complication of GA. Following T4G, patients may have an unrecognized duodenal stump, which can pose a risk for postoperative complications such as acid reflux, peptic ulcers, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Delayed duodenal stump blow-out can also lead to an increased risk for metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.
To evaluate the frequency, causes, and outcomes of delayed duodenal stump blow-out following T4G, we conducted a retrospective study of patient charts at our institution. Our data show that delayed duodenal stump blow-out is rare, affecting only 6% of all T4G patients. In these cases, there was no clear trend toward increased risk factors or severity of preexisting gastrointestinal conditions. Instead, delayed duodenal stump blow-out seemed to be the result of suboptimal surgical technique or an unexpected finding on routine anatomic studies.
In conclusion, delayed duodenal stump blow-out following T4G is unlikely to be caused by any single factor or clinical scenario. Rather, it appears to be the result of a combination of factors, some of which are within the control of the surgeon and others which are not. Delayed duodenal stump blow-out should be included in the differential diagnosis of GA complications, particularly in patients with risk factors or unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Question: Are lipoprotein phospholipase A2 mass and activity associated with the diagnosis of acute brain ischemia?

Results of this study did not find evidence to support a correlation between lipoprotein (a2) phospholipase A2 activity or MCV level and the diagnosis of acute brain ischemia. In patients with acute brain ischemia, an increased MCV is correlated with additional biomarkers which may have prognostic value. Additionally, lipoproteins are not specific for acute brain ischemia and other diseases do not alter their normal physiological function. Therefore, the use of lipoproteins as biomarkers for acute brain ischemia is controversial at best.

Do a new model for the standardization of experimental burn wounds?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The task of standardizing experimental burn wound models is a complex and varied one. It could involve any number of disciplines, including but not limited to:

- Bioengineering: Discovering and developing new materials and techniques for burn wound management.

- Chemistry: Identifying and studying the chemical components of burn wounds.

- Dermatology: Examining the skin to understand the impact of burns on the physical and psychological health of the victim.

- Emergency Medicine: Treating patients with burn injuries by applying knowledge and skills gained through the other disciplines.

- Forensic Sciences: Investigating and documenting burn wounds as part of a larger investigation into crime and punishment.

It is important to note that no single approach or combination of approaches will be sufficient for all burn wounds. Instead, burn wound models should be developed based on the unique characteristics of each case. Moreover, it may be necessary to modify or adapt existing models depending on the requirements of specific studies. Therefore, it is essential to consider both the specifics of each case and the available resources when designing burn wound models.

### Question: Does circulating atrial natriuretic peptide genetic association study identify a novel gene cluster associated with stroke in whites?
### Final Decision: This is the first large-scale genetic association study of circulating NT-proANP levels performed with replication and functional assessment that identified genetic variants in the MTHFR-CLCN6-NPPA-NPPB cluster to be significantly associated with NT-proANP levels. The clinical significance of this variation is related to lower NT-proANP levels, higher blood pressures, and an increased risk of stroke in the general community.

Circulating atrial natriuretic peptide (CNPP) and other neurohormonal factors play important roles in cardiovascular health. A SNP in the AGTR1 gene encoding a protein involved in CNPP biosynthesis is associated with stroke risk in white persons. Other SNPs in CNPP biosynthetic genes appear to be protective against stroke risk. These results implicate a novel gene cluster involving multiple CNPP synthesis genes in the etiology of stroke in whites.

### Question: Do whole-genome sequencing and epidemiological analysis provide evidence for cross-transmission of mycobacterium abscessus in a cohort of pediatric cystic fibrosis patients?
